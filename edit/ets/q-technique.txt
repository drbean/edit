Teaching for Enhancing Innovation Ability Using Q-technique

This study was to confirm the Q-technique instruction effect of enhancing the innovation ability of students. The focus group and quasi-experimental method were applied. First of all, the innovation ability was confirmed by experts to be a professional competency required by enterprises. Next, the Q-technique unit instruction and experiment designed to verify the instruction effect of cultivating students with the innovation ability. It was discovered that the innovation ability was composed of eight indices, and the Q-technique can upgrade the students’ innovation ability. In the application in practice, the Q-technique can attain the integral learning in a systematic manner from the creativity till the innovative products in technology; to suffice the deficiency in innovation ability literatures of the “process perspective”. In the aspect of contribution, the Q-technique can be applied to innovative instructions and the changes of mental models, valuable to the reform of innovation teaching. 

Introduction
How to reduce the difference between the innovation ability requirements of enterprises and the cultivation curriculum shall be an important issue in employability (Støren & Aamodt, 2012). Through higher education, the difference between the work requirements and the competences of employers can be shortened, in order to reduce the occurrence ratio in the difference between job requirements and education results (Green et al, 2002). The industry demand oriented professional competency shall be an important basis for the curriculum innovation. Therefore, through a continued innovation in curriculum, and successive focusing on the professional competency requirements, the employability of the students can then be upgraded, and the education and service compliance of the graduated students be promoted (Li, Yen, & Cheng, 2008；Chang & Chang, 2011).

Conclusions
The “innovation ability” is one of the important professional competencies required in IT industry. Therefore, this study adopts the “process perspective” of creativity to serve as its study approach. In the first stage, through literature review and focus group expert consultations, such eight indices as market sensitivity, organizational integration, complexity, originality, flexibility, novelty, fluency, and creative impulse, etc. of innovation ability are obtained. In accordance with the pre-test and post-test scales of the completion of development for each index, the instruction effect can be effectively verified.

Teaching for Enhancing Innovation Ability Using Q-technique

This study confirms the instructional effect of the Q-technique in enhancing the innovation ability of students, with research applying focus group and quasi-experimental methods. First, innovation ability was confirmed by experts to be a professional competency required by enterprises. Next, Q-technique instruction in the form of an experiment designed to increase students' innovativeness was performed. In the course of the experiment, it was determined that innovation ability is composed of eight components, and the Q-technique upgrades students’ innovativeness. In application in practice, the Q-technique can result in integral learning in a systematic manner from the first creative stages till the realization of an innovative product in technology; and with this, a deficiency in the “process perspective” innovation instruction literature is supplemented. Its contribution is it demonstrates the Q-technique can be applied in innovative instruction and result in mental model changes, valuable to the reform of innovation teaching. 

Introduction

How to reduce the difference between the innovation ability requirements of enterprises and the focus of innovation curricula is an important issue in employability (Støren & Aamodt, 2012). Through higher education, the difference between work requirements and the competencies of employees can be alleviated, reducing the frequency of a mismatch between job requirements and education results (Green et al, 2002). However, industry demand-oriented professional competencies must be an important basis for curriculum innovation. Therefore, through a continued innovation in curriculum, and successive focusing on professional competency requirements, the employability of students can be upgraded, and the education and service compliance of graduated students can be promoted (Li, Yen, & Cheng, 2008；Chang & Chang, 2011).

Conclusions
“Innovation ability” is one of the most important professional competencies required in the IT industry. Therefore, this study sought to determine how it could be better taught, adopting the “process perspective” as its approach. In the first stage, through literature review and focus group expert consultations, eight indices, namely, market sensitivity, organizational integration, complexity, originality, flexibility, novelty, fluency, and creative impulse, which together allowed a precise determination of innovation ability, were obtained. By means of the pre-test and post-test scales as they stood at the completion of development, the instruction effect could be effectively verified for each index.
