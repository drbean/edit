CHAPTER ONE

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Background and Motivation

A rich body of research has documented that a child's letter name
knowledge is an important predictor of future reading ability (Adam,
1990; Ball & Blachman, 1991; Bowles, Pentimonti, Gerde, & Montroy, 2014,
Foulin, 2005; Hammill, 2004; NELP, 2008; Piasta, Petscher, & Justice,
2012;). Children who have difficulty recognizing the 26 English letters
will struggle with follow-up learning activities which mostly assume a basic
letter-recognition ability. The extent of children's letter name knowledge 
influences their literacy-related skills and consequentially, also influences
their reading achievement (Foulin, 2005). According to McBride-Chang's (1999)
findings, both letter name knowledge and letter sound knowledge affect
reading-related skills.

In Taiwan, young EFL learners (first and second grade students) are
expected to become proficient and fluent in their letter name and letter
sound knowledge. However, children differ considerably in their
alphabetic knowledge. In most Taiwan elementary schools, a pronounced bimodality
exists in English classroom classes. Students' English reading
abilities differ considerably (Li, 2010). When first-grade children
begin their first English class in elementary schools, some children
already know how to read and write the 52 uppercase and lowercase
English letters as they started learning English in cram schools or
bilingual preschools when they were toddlers. However, for the other
children, it is their first English class. They are just about to
begin their English learning journeys. There is no evidence that the gap
between students is closed as children move on to the next
learning stage. When they are in their third grade, their English
academic achievement still tends to lag behind.

To close the gap in letter knowledge and to help students who are
behind to catch up with the others, English teachers in Taiwan usually have
to differentiate their instruction in class or spend extra time after
class conducting remedial instruction for the low-achieving students.
The content of differentiated instruction or remedial instruction
typically includes alphabet knowledge. Normally, when English
teachers begin their new classes, they consider who has mastered
alphabetic knowledge and who has not. To benchmark students'
alphabet knowledge, the accepted way is to check how many letters their
students can recognize. This benchmark information is important as
it is required by differentiated or remedial instruction that moves beyond the typical
sequence of whole-class instruction (i.e., starting at ABC and working through all 26 letters to XYZ) to provide
the instruction needed by individual children (Piasta, 2014). Such benchmarking just checks letter name knowledge, but letter
name knowledge is perhaps more important than letter sound knowledge as
knowledge of letter names precedes knowledge of letter sounds (Levin,
Shatil-Carmon, & Asif-Rave, 2006). Letter name knowledge predicts
subsequent development of letter sound knowledge whereas letter sound
knowledge does not predict subsequent development of letter-name
knowledge (McBride-Chang, 1999). To understand the extent to which a
student has achieved letter name knowledge, it is important to
have a screening test of letter names or a checklist that can be
administered efficiently and reliably.

1.2. Statement of the Problem

To monitor children's learning pace, an alphabet checklist or test is
essential. There exist alphabet assessments used in
preschool or kindergarten for L1 children, such as the CIRCLE Phonological
Awareness, Language and Literacy System(C-PALLS), Rapid Letter Naming,
Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBLS), Letter Naming
Fluency, Phonological Awareness Literacy Screening (PALS), Alphabet
Knowledge, Letter Sounds (Invernizzi, Juel, & Meier, 2003), Clay's
Observation Survey: Alphabet Knowledge (Clay, 2002), and Woodcock Reading
Mastery Tests (Woodcock, 1998) assessments. Ideally, to understand what alphabetic
instruction should be given to a particular student, the student should
be tested with all the letters, including uppercase and lowercase
letters. However, to have children read aloud 26 uppercase and 26
lowercase letters is time-consuming as the test has to be administered
on an individual basis (*Tortorelli, Bowles & Skibbe, 2017, p. 149*). It
is necessary to have a valid assessment that teachers can administer
efficiently and repeatedly. Such a test is needed because, in addition to understanding
a student's readiness for alphabetic learning, teachers also need to
check children's development of alphabetic learning at regular intervals, typically
at the beginning, in the middle, and at the end of the school semester.
For this reason, *Tortorelli* et al. (2017) developed a quick, effective
assessment of letter name knowledge called the Quick Letter Name Knowledge
(Q-LNK) Assessment. The assessment was based on Bowles et al.'s (2014)
research, with data collected from 1,113 preschoolers of L1 English who
were required to name all of the uppercase and lowercase letters of the
alphabet. After collecting the data, Bowles et al. used Item
Response Theory methods to analyze preschoolers' letter name knowledge.
The result is a letter name knowledge assessment that has
fewer items and measures an extended range of ability while maintaining
high levels of reliability (Bowles et al, 2014). The Q-LNK assessment
includes six short forms testing letter name knowledge. Each form
strategically chooses eight letters out of the 52 uppercase and
lowercase letters, significantly reducing the time and effort required to gauge a student's letter name knowledge, by testing 
eight letters instead of 52. While the test can be administered in
less than a minute, its reliability is still high (Bowles et al., 2014).
The Q-LNK was designed so teachers and others could use it for quick screening and benchmark
testing purposes. The total score is eight. The teacher can estimate how many
letters a student has currently acquired in total as a percentage of the score
from the eight letters in the form. The higher the score a student gets, the
more letters he/she knows.

Whether the Q-LNK can be successfully introduced in Taiwan
is still an empirical question. All the relevant research has been conducted
with young English L1 learners in North America. The letters in each
form were selected according to the difficulty level of the letters
for English L1 learners. However, English L2 learners in Taiwan may
not experience the same types of difficulty with the alphabet as English L1 children. The
foremost question is whether children who are English L2 learners in Taiwan exhibit the same
patterns of difficulty with different letters as L1 learners. If they
don't, then the Q-LNK may not be a valid tool for assessment of
the letter name knowledge of English L2 learners in Taiwan. Furthermore, it
is not clear whether its six different forms yield comparable results for
L2 learners as they do for L1 learners. If the six short forms of letter
name knowledge are not comparable, then they cannot be used to benchmark
letter name progress and development in L2 learners. As the test forms
are constructed based on the difficulty of the letters, the validity
of the test is compromised if L2 learners do not have similar
difficulty with all 26 letters as L1 learners. Thus, there is a need to
examine whether the Q-LNK is a valid assessment tool of
letter name knowledge for English L2 learners in Taiwan. If the screening and benchmark test
successfully measures children's letter name knowledge
in L2 young learners, then its introduction will benefit
English teachers in Taiwan as it provides useful information 
for making effective instructional decisions and for monitoring the
developmental trajectories of alphabetic knowledge in students.

1.3 Research Questions

The current study is guided by the following research questions:

1.  Are the six forms of the Q-LNK Assessment valid in predicting the
    > number of letters known by L2 learners in Taiwan?

2.  Are the forms comparable in terms of difficulty so that they can be
    > used multiple times as benchmark assessments to monitor the
    > alphabetic progress of L2 learners in Taiwan?

3 . What other factors should be taken into consideration in using the forms
    > (e.g., children's names)?

1.4 Significance of the Study

**The goal of the study is to investigate the practicality and
feasibility of use of the Q-LNK assessment with young Taiwan EFL learners. If the
Q-LNK is valid in predicting the total number of letter names
known by children, the language teacher can make teaching decisions
according to the results of the assessment. For instance, which students
are falling behind in terms of their letter name knowledge? Is the
student receiving remedial instruction making meaningful progress? With quick answers
to the above questions, language teachers will be able to make effective teaching
plans based on their children's specific needs. And, children will benefit from
the teacher's targeted alphabet instruction. **

1.5 Definitions of Terms

**The following terms, as regards to the present study, are defined for
this area of research overall:**

***Letter knowledge***

**Children with letter knowledge are children who can recognize
all uppercase and lowercase letters. They know the letter names and
letter sounds. Letter knowledge is considered a major stepping stone on
the path to reading.**

***Letter Name Knowledge***

**Letter name knowledge is a narrower skill under letter knowledge.
Children with letter name knowledge are mastering the uppercase and
lowercase letters and can say letter names. Letter name knowledge is the
foundation of letter knowledge. The development of letter name knowledge
helps children transit to letter sound knowledge and phonics. It's
the very beginning skill in reading.**

***Letter Name Knowledge Assessment***

**Letter name knowledge assessment is the testing of children's
letter naming ability. Children need to name some or all uppercase and lowercase
letters during such tasks. Letter name knowledge assessments are 
instruments to help language teachers to understand what children know
and what they still need to learn.**

CHAPTER TWO

**LITERATURE REVIEW**

This literature review consists of four sections. The first section
compares alphabet knowledge standards in the US and Taiwan. The
second section explores letter name knowledge. The third section
reviews the previous research on alphabet assessment. The final section
provides an overview of the present study.

2.1 The Alphabet Knowledge Standard

Alphabet knowledge, including letter name knowledge, letter sound
knowledge, and letter writing ability, is one of the most fundamental
early literacy abilities. (Adam, 1990; Ball & Blachman, 1991; Hammill,
2004; McBride-Chang, 1999; Piasta & Wagner, 2010) The starting point of
alphabet knowledge is learning the letter names. According to
Piasta, Petscher, and Justice (2012), "The ability to name the letters
of the alphabet during preschool and kindergarten is a well-established
predictor of children's later literacy skills." This important
literacy ability in children's reading acquisition is established as
a learning goal by US government bodies and other organizations in the US. Table 2.1.1
shows preschool and
kindergarten benchmarks for letter naming ability there (National Governors Association Center for Best Practices &
Council of Chief State School Officers, 2010; Office of Head Start,
2015).

As can be seen from Table 2.1.1, the letter naming ability standards developed by
US national and professional organizations apply from early childhood and specify in
detail a series of stages through which development will take place. Each stage prescribes the
exact number of letter names which children are expected to know. At the end of
kindergarten and before entering the first grade, children need to be able to
name all the uppercase and lowercase letters of the alphabet.

*Note*. Adapted from Tortorelli et al. (2017).

In Taiwan, alphabetic knowledge standards are less specific. English
is a foreign language, rather than a community language. Given that
English has developed into a global language due to the prosperity brought about by
global communication, many English as foreign language (EFL) countries,
including Taiwan, place great importance on English in basic education.
English has been promoted as a main subject for primary school students in
Taiwan since 2001. At that time, English study began in fifth grade.
Four years later in 2005, the start of English teaching was moved one to two years earlier to third or fourth grade (Ministry of Education, 2005; Feng,
2019). As of 2019, several counties in Taiwan had moved the English
starting point to first and second grade, including Taipei
City, New Taipei City, and Taoyuan City. This decision made by the
education departments of city governments show there exists a push to to start formal
English education at an increasingly earlier age in Taiwan. In September
2019, the Ministry of Education (MOE) promulgated a 12-year Basic
Education curriculum (MOE, 2014). In the 12-year 
curriculum framework and its MOE-mandated courses, which are designed by the
government to develop students' basic abilities, there are no hours for
English in first and second grade. However, the framework provides space
for each school to develop its own school curriculum. Each school can
design its curriculum according to its own developmental vision. To build
up student's English ability, the majority of elementary schools in
Taiwan are incorporating English in an integrative theme course, which is
subordinate to the alternative curriculum and school-developed
curriculum. The course begins in first grade.

The national curriculum, the 12-year Basic Education Framework in Taiwan,
specifies learning performance levels that students at each learning stage
are expected to achieve. These performance indicators are similar to the concept
of learning goals or learning standards in the US (Table 2.1.2). The
performance indicators for letter name knowledge include listening,
speaking, reading, and writing. Those for letter
reading and letter writing incorporate knowledge of upper- and lowercase
letters. The table shows that elementary school students need to
recognize and differentiate between the uppercase and lowercase letters
in reading and writing.

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

Comparing the national standards of letter name ability between the US
and Taiwan reveals a noticeable difference. Since English is a mother
tongue in the US, learning letter names starts at a considerably earlier
age and the stages are co-ordinated with children's mental development and
their learning condition. Also, the standards offer the specific number of
letters that children are expected to reach in each stage. This provides a useful
checklist for both parents and teachers to determine if their children
are on track or if they need extra help in the development of
alphabetic knowledge.

Yet for EFL in Taiwan, the performance indicators in the national
curriculum do not specify step-by-step milestones for letter learning.
They only specify the intended final learning outcomes in that students
should learn to hear, speak, read, and write all the letters from grade 3 up
to grade 4 (or in school-developed curricula: from grade 1 up to grade 2).
There are no intermediate goals for the two-year period of the learning of the letters.
This lack of specification of intermediate goals causes some
problems. Using the MOE's mandated learning performance framework, when teachers examine
learning at each stage of the course over two years, there is no clear level reference for them to
monitor children's learning progress. Without intermediate goals to
gauge children's progress, English teachers will not be able to tell whether
a child is on pace to achieve the goal, or whether more support 
should be offered, so that the child can read, write, hear and speak all 26 letters, both upper- and lowercase at the
end of the two years.

2.2 Letter Name Knowledge

The main foundation of reading is alphabet knowledge, which is also one
of the strongest factors affecting children's future reading achievement
(Adam, 1990). According to a report of the National Early Literacy
Panel in the US, alphabet knowledge is defined as "knowledge of the
names and sounds associated with printed letters" (NELP, 2008). Though
knowledge of letter name and letter sound are both important in terms of
alphabetic literacy acquisition, there are some unique and unreplaceable
characteristics of letter name knowledge that deserve attention. In this section, the
important elements of letter name knowledge affecting children's early
literacy skills, the properties of letter name knowledge, and the stages
of development of letter name knowledge will be discussed.

2.2.1 The importance of Letter Name Knowledge

Compared to letter names, letter sounds are more frequently used in reading
and speaking. When children read a word aloud, the language skill involved
is letter sound knowledge rather than letter name knowledge. In that case, why have letter names
nevertheless been widely discussed? According to previous studies, both
knowledge of letter names and letter sounds are individual predictors of reading
achievement (Adam, 1990; Ball & Blachman, 1991; Foulin, 2005; Hammill,
2004; McBride-Chang, 1999; NELP, 2008). However, letter name knowledge
develops earlier than letter sound knowledge and is more variable than
the latter when children are in kindergarten (Foulin, 2005).
Once all the children are skilled in letter name knowledge, letter
sound knowledge takes over and becomes the main predictor of reading achievement
(Foulin, 2005). This indicates that letter name knowledge is the foundation of
reading skills and that it plays an important role in the early development of
alphabetic knowledge.

Letter names provide children with memory storage hooks to identify letter
shapes. When children spell a word, e.g. "elephant" that they see in a book, it is conventional
that they spell the word by saying the letters' names, "E-L-E-P-H-A-N-T"
rather than letter sounds. When seeing the letter, children will remember
its shape by saying its name. Letter names help children connect
the letter names they say to their referents, that is, connect speech
to print while recognizing the printed words (Adams, 1990; Ehri, 1985).
Letter name knowledge allows children to bridge the gap from visual-cue
strategy (the shapes of letter names) to phonetic-cue strategy (letter
names) (Foulin, 2005). Gradually, children will treat words as sequences
of letters. Once the children are familiar with letter names and letter
shapes, they begin to read and learn more words (Adams, 1990).

In addition, letter name knowledge helps children learn letter sounds
effectively. Letter names are related to letter sounds. When children say a
letter name, for example, D (dee), the beginning sound of the letter name
represents the letter sound /d/. Another example is F. The final
sound of the letter name represents the letter sound /f/. Letter name knowledge
serves as a guide for children, helping them to learn letter sounds.  Children
can make good use of the association between letter names and letter sounds to
learn and remember letter sounds (Piasta & Wagner, 2010).

Previous studies have investigated the relationship between letter name
knowledge and letter sound knowledge and have focused on the questions: "Does
letter name affect phoneme learning?" and "Does phoneme affect letter name learning?" The
results show that the learning of letter sounds is affected by letter names
(Adams, 1990; Treiman, Weatherston, & Berch, 1994; Treiman, & Broderick,
1998; McBride-Chang, 1999). Among the 26 letters, the letter sounds
that are mostly accessible are those with CV-structure letter names, for example,
B, D, J, K, P, Q, T, V, and Z. The above letter names begin with the
letter sounds that the letters represent. The next most accessible letter
sounds are VC-structure letter names, for example, F, L, M, N, S, and X.
The letter sounds of these VC-structure letters fall at the end of
letter names. The above properties of letter names make it easier for children
to acquire those letter sounds.

Letter names and letter sounds can be confused in some circumstances.
For instance, when children write the word, elephant, 
intuition will lead them to write the letter "L" instead of "el" because the beginning
sound of "elephant" is similar to the letter name "L".

In conclusion, what are the relationships between letter names, letter
sounds, and reading achievement? Letter name knowledge is the beginning
skill and is the precursor of letter sound knowledge. Letter sounds play the role
of a mediator which connects letter names to reading achievement
(Foulin, 2005). If children have stable and fluent letter name
abilities, they can rapidly match letter names to letter sounds.
The less time they take to react to letters, the easier and faster they
can decode a word (Adams, 1990). After that, they can immerse themselves in
extensive reading.

Letter name knowledge is related to not only the acquisition of letter
shapes and letter sounds but also phonemic sensitivity (Foulin, 2005).
By seeing a letter in print and saying its letter name, children
gradually acquire the concept that letter names and printed letters maintain
a correspondence with phonemes. Letter name knowledge 
leads children to an understanding of the segmentation of spoken words and provides them with an insight into their phonemic structures (Wagner, Torgesen, &
Rashotte, 1994). With the knowledge of letter names and letter sounds,
children are able to manipulate and identify the segments involved in a
word. As pointed out by Byrne, Ball, and Blachman (1991, 1998), "Letter
name knowledge is associated with good phonemic sensitivity skills and
it appears as helpful for beginners learning alphabetic literacy as the
combination of letter-sound knowledge and phonemic sensitivity."

2.2.2 The properties of Letter Name Knowledge

A feature of letter name knowledge is that it is constrained, a concept
introduced by Paris's (2005)
constrained skills theory, with its distinction between reading abilities 
which are unconstrained, like vocabulary and those which are constrained, like letter name
knowledge. The theory places reading-related skills onto
a continuum from the most highly constrained skills 
 to the most highly unconstrained skills. Constrained reading
skills require the learning of a limited number of items (Stahl, 2011), and include writing one's name, knowledge of the alphabet and high-frequency words,
phonics, and phonological awareness. The items to be learned are limited
in number. Unconstrained reading skills include oral reading
fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension. These skills place no limit
on the items that need to be learned. There are always new words to learn over a reader's
lifetime. Moreover, the development pathways followed learning constrained skills are
similar for each person; however, the development pathways learning
unconstrained skills are distinctive and unique for every person.
Figure 2.2.2.1 displays the continuum of constraint for a range of
reading-related skills.

Alphabetic knowledge is a constrained skill, because of the limited numbers of letters in
the alphabet, which consists of 52 items, 26 uppercase letters and 26
lowercase letters in total. Constrained skills share some characteristics.
First, a constrained skill is usually learned in a
short time frame. Due to the limited number of items, children do not need to
spend a long time, like a few years, to master alphabetic knowledge.
In English speaking countries, alphabet instruction starts in
kindergarten or preschool. In Taiwan, alphabet instruction lasts two
school years. Hence, instruction is also limited to an interval in time (Paris, 2005).

Second, the developmental pathways of constrained skills are universal.
Every child receives alphabet instruction so that the skills they
develop are similar and predictable (Stahl, 2011). It is not difficult for
language teachers to understand how well children have learned the alphabet and
what alphabet stage they are currently in.

Third, due to the limited number of items in the alphabet, as a constrained skill, alphabet
knowledge assessment usually yields results that reflect what children practice during lessons.
It is easy to see improvement and growth in measurement
results when children are given lots of practice. Because instruction
in highly-constrained skills should be effective, time-efficient, and
systematic, the time given to instruction should be short and targeted to
children's current levels (Stahl, 2011). Assessment ought to be
efficient, too. Though it is easy for teachers to see
improvement through measurement, the seeking of time-efficient measurement is another
consideration. The Q-LNK assessment is a suitable solution satisfying the above
requirements as it can save time when diagnosing children's learning
difficulties and can provide useful information to guide appropriate teaching
decisions.

Besides the constrained property, letter name knowledge has some other
characteristics that are discussed in Piasta's (2014)
study. The first characteristic is the primacy effect of learning letter
names. The beginning letters of the alphabet, A, B, and C, are the
letters with which young children are most familiar, probably due to the contribution
of popular ABC songs. Children sing the songs so often in
the early literacy period that they pick up the beginning letters
without effort. Moreover, order effects are also a property of 
letter names. When referring to sequences and orders, such as the
arrangement of books or finding one's seat, practically all sequences start
with A, B, C. As a consequence, most children are not familiar with the last few letters in the alphabet, X, Y,
and Z.

The second property of letter names is the frequency with which certain letters which are worthy of notice
are encountered in the environment. The word, "The", at
the beginning of story sentences catches children's eyes. The word
shows up mostly in every book and at a clear-cut position at the starting
point of sentences. Children may learn to recognize the letter "T" quickly. In
addition to the word "The", the letter "a," is also a letter that
frequently shows up in storybooks. Children get familiar with the letter
"a" through reading storybooks.

The third property of letter names is that some, but not all, letter names incorporate the corresponding
letter sounds. For example, the letters B, D, L, and M are ones where children mostly
recognize the sounds of the letters because the sounds are included in
the letter names. For the letters, H, W and Y, the letter sounds are not incorporated, making them more difficult (Piasta & Wagner, 2010).

The fourth property of letter names is the visual similarities of
letters. Some of the letters look the same in uppercase and lowercase.
(e.g., "O" and "o"). Children usually recognize them easily. However, 
letters that look similar may confuse children (e.g., t and f, b and d,
p and q). In addition, some of the letter shapes of letters are quite
distinct from the shapes of the 25 others. These letters are mostly recognizable by children
(e.g., "x") (Treiman & Kessler, 2003).

Lastly, there are some special phonological similarities involved in the
pronunciation of letter names. The letters B, C, D, E, and G include the /i/
sound at the end of the letter names. The letters F, H, L, M, and N include the /e/
sound at the beginning of their names. Children can learn letters more easily
if they have similar pronunciations. Also, letter names containing phonemes
like the bilabial sounds, B /b/, P /p/ and M /m/, should be easier to
pronounce than letter names containing the difficult phonemes Z /z/ and J
/dʒ/ (Justice, Pence, Bowles & Wiggins 2006).

2.2.3 The Development of Letter Name Knowledge

Given the constrained properties of letter name knowledge, English L1
children show similar developmental letter name knowledge pathways
(Stahl, 2011). For language teachers, understanding the development of
letter name knowledge will help them to know which developmental stage
the children are currently in so that they can make appropriate instructional
decisions. Figure 2.2.3.1 displays the development of letter name
knowledge by Tortorelli et al. (2017).

height="2.3777777777777778in"}

*Note.* Selected from Tortorelli et al. (2017).

At the beginning stage, English L1 children will learn the ABC song, recognize
their name's initials, and know distinct uppercase letters such as O
and X. Also, because of the order effect, they will be familiar with the
uppercase letters at the beginning of the alphabet, that is, A, B, C.
At the middle stage, children will recognize more uppercase letters and some
lowercase letters, especially those letters with lowercase shapes
resembling their uppercase counterparts, for example, C/c, O/o, S/s.
Children will also recognize several high-frequency lowercase letters such as
"e" and "s". They will start to learn some phonemes which provide sound
clues to letter names, for example, B, P, F, and S. In the last
stage, children are able to recognize most uppercase and lowercase
letters. However, they may confuse some similar-looking letters such as
b and d, t and f, and p and q. Moreover, they will be beginning to learn the letter
sounds that are not related to letter names, for example, H and W
(Bowles et al., 2014; Evans, Bell, Shaw, Moretti, &Page, 2006, Huang &
Invernizzi, 2012; Justice et al., 2006; McBride-Chang, 1999; Treiman &
Broderick, 1998).

Ehri (2009) proposed four phases describing how English L1 children
learn to read a word at sight. The four phases delineate a broader view
of sight word reading than the developmental stages of letter name
knowledge of Tortorelli et al. (2017). The four phases are
pre-alphabetic, partial alphabetic, full alphabetic, and consolidated
alphabetic.

Children in the pre-alphabetic phase know little about the alphabetic
system. When they read words, they do not form letter-sound connections
to read words. They read the words by remembering the words' visual
features. Like the word "look", the two "o"s in the middle of the word
look like the eyes looking at someone. The special visual features make
it easy for children to recognize the word. Children may recognize the
word, but if the word is spelled incorrectly, for example, "fook" for
"look", children may still read the word as "look" by its overall shape,
ignoring the misspelled part. In this phase, if children can read words
fluently, it is not because they can read the words through the
application of the alphabetic principle, but because they have already
memorized the words by listening to and seeing them many times or
because they just read the words with some contextual cues such as
pictures. There is no
pre-alphabetic phase in the letter name knowledge development process in
Tortorelli et al.'s (2017) study.

Children in the partial alphabetic phase are learning letter names and
letter sounds and using them to read a word. However, they can only
segment the first and the final letter sounds. They cannot segment the whole word
into pronunciation of its constituent phonemes. Children lack full letter knowledge so
it is difficult for them to decode unfamiliar words. The partial
alphabetic phase entirely matches the whole process of the development of letter name
knowledge of Tortorelli et al. (2017). At the end of the development of
letter name knowledge in the paper of Tortorelli et al., (2017) children
begin to develop their phonics skills. Similar to Ehri's partial
alphabetic phase (2009), children know the letter names and sounds and
can read the sounds of the first and final letters.

In the full alphabetic phase, learners are able to decode unfamiliar
words. They can segment pronunciation into phonemes and match the
phonemes with the graphemes they see. Moreover, they can remember the
correct spelling of words.

The last phase proposed by Ehri (2009) is the consolidated phase.
Learners are familiar with letter patterns that recur in different
words. Learners can memorize larger units or chunks within a word so
that they can learn more difficult words easily. There are no
developmental pathways in Tortorelli et al. (2017) corresponding to
Ehri's full alphabetic and consolidated phases.

In the paper of Tortorelli et al. (2017), the researchers demonstrate clear
letter name development pathways and they detail characteristics of development in each
period. Ehri's (2009) study presents a broader view of word reading.
Even though the two studies differ in the focus of their
theories, both highlight an important point about the
development of alphabetic knowledge: English L1 children go through 
phases in the acquisition of alphabetic knowledge and the
acquisition process is similar across children. For English L2 children,
the developmental path is less clear.

2.3 Alphabet Assessment

Alphabet assessments provide language teachers with information about
children's learning problems and needs. Using assessment data,
teachers can set specific teaching goals for alphabet instruction.
Although there is a general path of development of alphabetic knowledge,
not every child follows exactly the same path at the same speed. Alphabet assessments help
teachers determine the differences in children's letter name knowledge.
Piasta (2014) collects several letter name knowledge assessments in her
study and argues that these different assessments provide teachers with options, allowing them to
select a suitable assessment according to their requirements. For
instance, when teachers have a new class of students, it is necessary
for teachers to know each student's level of letter name knowledge. A
screening assessment is essential. The "Dynamic Indicators of Basic
Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS) -- Letter Naming Fluency" test is a kind
of screening test. This test measures children's rate of letter naming.
Students need to read out a form with many letters on it and read the
letter names as fast as they can. However, "for young learners, the rate
of letter naming is not necessarily as important as accuracy" (Speece,
Mills, Ritchey, & Hillman, 2003; Tortorelli et al., 2017). The timed
test cannot show children's real letter name knowledge because it puts them under
time pressure. Besides, teachers cannot collect detailed information
about children's letter naming through a timed test (Tortorelli et al.,
2017), so it may not be the most appropriate screening test.

Another type of alphabet assessment is diagnostic assessment, which
helps language teachers pinpoint out students' letter name knowledge
learning problems. One example is Clay's (2002) Observation Survey of
Early Literacy Achievement. The assessment provides a list of uppercase
and lowercase letters in random order. Children need to read out the
letter names following the predetermined order. If children read the
letter name incorrectly, the test administer will record children's
errors on the record sheet. Such a diagnostic letter name knowledge
assessment helps teachers collect children's errors individually.
Teachers can take an insight into a child's current developmental level
of letter name knowledge and plan differentiated alphabet instruction
for the individual child or children in a small group. Even though
giving diagnostic letter name assessment helps language teachers
understand each child's letter name knowledge, the time of administering
assessment is still a big problem. Young children, as well as teachers,
may become overly fatigued towards the end of tests (i.e., after they
read 52 items). The cognitive fatigue caused by the lengthy test may
reduce the validity of the test (Tortorelli et al., 2017).

At the end of the alphabet instruction, a benchmark assessment can be
used to check children's overall progress in letter name learning. The
results of the assessment will decide whether children are capable
enough of moving to the next letter sound instruction. Most of the
benchmark assessments are large, which include many subtests such as
Woodcock Reading Mastery Tests (Woodcock, 1998). The subtests tap into
different aspects of linguistic skills such as listening comprehension,
oral fluency, phonemic awareness, and rapid automatic naming in. Other
tests like the Test of Preschool Early Literacy (Lonigan, Wagner,
Torgesen & Rashotte, 2007) include a subtest called "Print Knowledge",
which requires children to identify the letter and words, point to
specific letters, name the specific letters, identify letters associated
with specific sounds, and say the sounds associated with specific
letters. It takes a long time to finish the test. The test items involve
many skills and thus the information revealed by the test scores is not
specific enough for teachers to plan letter name instruction (Tortorelli
et al., 2017).

The above alphabet assessments have their own proper time to use, at the
beginning of the school year or the end of the school year. Also, the
alphabet assessments have their purposes to use, knowing overall
progress, or knowing the detailed information in children. However, none
of the assessments contains all the following features: efficient,
time-saving, and be able to get detailed information. The following
section presents such an assessment, the Q-LNK, which is the primary
interest of the present study.

2.4 The Quick Letter Name Knowledge Assessment

The Q-LNK Assessment is a quick, reliable, research-based letter name
knowledge assessment. It can efficiently assess student's letter name
knowledge, screen children who might have problems in letter naming
knowledge, and to monitor their progress in letter name knowledge over
time (Tortorelli et al., 2017). The theoretical background of the Q-LNK
assessment is that letters differ from one another in their difficulty
(Bowles et al., 2014; Huang & Invernizzi, 2014; Justice et al., 2006;
McBride-Chang, 1999; Phillps et al., 2012; Piasta, 2014). Some of the
letters are easy to be picked up by students while others are not.
Figure 2.4.1 presents the typical order in which letter names and letter
sounds are acquired. From this figure, it is important to know that each
letter is different among others. The typical order provides the
information that some of the uppercase letters are easy to learn and
teachers may focus their instruction on difficult letter names (Piasta,
2014). However, the typical order does not consider the lowercase
letters.

Are Required*

  V                                
                  More Difficult   

*Note.* Selected from Piasta (2014).

The Q-LNK assessment is developed based on Bowles et al.'s (2014)
research. The research collected uppercase and lowercase letter name
knowledge from 1,113 preschoolers and analyzed the collected data by
item response theory. The conclusions of the research include three
points. First, uppercase letters tend to be easier and more
discriminating but had a narrow range of difficulty. Second, including
lowercase letters in the assessment increases the range of difficulty.
Children who are near to ceiling in uppercase letters may not have the
same ceiling effect in lowercase. Including lowercase letters improves
the validity of the test for children with higher levels of letter name
knowledge. Lastly and most importantly, it is not necessary to assess
both uppercase and lowercase letters in their entirety because the
reliability exceeds the typical acceptance. The letter name knowledge
assessment may only include a selection of uppercase and lowercase
letters so that it shortens the assessment time while keeping the
assessment with high reliability (Bowles et al., 2014).

Tortorelli et al., (2017) created six forms (Table 2.4.2) with each
include eight strategically chosen letters based on the study of Bowles
et al.'s (2014) (Table 2.4.3). Each form contains different sets of
letters with a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters. Nevertheless,
four letters are not included in the six partition forms, which are C,
O, l, and x. In terms of the data from Bowles et al. (2014), the
difficulties of uppercase C and lowercase are very closed, so are the
difficulties of the letter O/o and the letter X/x. Therefore, one of the
uppercase and lowercase pairs is taken out from 52 letters.

As about how the letters arranged in each form, based on the difficulty
of uppercase and lowercase letters from Bowles et al. (2014) (Table
2.4.3), Tortorelli et al. (2017) arranged the letter order from easiest
to hardest. (Figure 2.4.4). The figure for letter recognition difficulty
includes children's initial. Afterward, according to the difficulty
order, the first six easier letters: o, B, A, X, S, and R (remove letter
O and x), are randomly distributed to each form. Then the next six
letters: c, M, K, s, E, and k, distributed to each form and so on until
all the letters are distributed.

After the six forms complete, the next step is to verify the reliability
and validity of each form. The reliability of each form is ranging from
.89 to .92, with the averaged .91, which shows that the six forms are
with high reliability. The validity was established by comparing the
scores on each form with the scores from each students' total LNK scores
(Tortorelli et al., 2017). The correspondence between the numbers of
letters is recognized in six forms and the numbers of total letter names
know are shown (Table 2.4.3).

The Q-LNK Assessment consists of many benefits. First, teachers can use
the forms at regular intervals to benchmark children's letter name
knowledge in learning blocks. Second, the assessment time is
substantially reduced so that teachers can have more time to plan to
differentiate instruction. Third, the six forms provide teachers with a
more convenient and quick way to assess, the forms can be used
repeatedly. With the above benefits, the Q-LNK Assessment seems a
helpful instrument for teachers who teach early literacy learners.

2.5 The Present Study

**The present study investigates the practicality and feasibility of the
Q-LNK Assessment for English L2 children in Taiwan. The Q-LNK Assessment
had been only used in America. There is not yet any research on the
practicality and feasibility of assessment in Taiwan. The present study
will** examine whether the **Q-LNK** Assessment will effectively
estimate how many uppercase and lowercase letters second-graders in
Taiwan know**. If the result is affirmative, then the Q-LNK Assessment
will help language teachers not only in Taiwan but other English as
foreign language countries. They can use the assessment with less time
to know students\' needs especially for classes with different English
levels students. **

The three research questions addressed in the present study are
reiterated in the following:

1.  Are the six forms of the Q-LNK Assessment valid in predicting the
    > number of letters known by L2 learners in Taiwan?

2.  Are the forms comparable in terms of difficulty so that they can be
    > used multiple times as benchmark assessments to monitor the
    > alphabetic progress of L2 learners in Taiwan?

> 3\. What factors should be taken into consideration in using the forms
> (e.g., children's names)?

CHAPTER THREE

METHODOLOGY

3.1 Participants

> The participants will be 129 second graders from public elementary
> schools in northern Taiwan. According to the English curriculum
> arrangement by the Department of Education in New Taipei City, Taoyuan
> City, and Hsinchu County, second graders need to master the sounds of
> the alphabets while first graders need to be able to name the
> alphabets. Therefore, the participants will be targeted at second
> grade students who had already received complete letter name
> instruction. The gender of the participants will hopefully balance.

3.2 Research Design

> To investigate whether the Q-LNK Assessment can effectively estimate
> letter name knowledge by second-grade students in Taiwan, the research
> will collect data of letter name knowledge by administering a
> letter-naming test that requires second-grade students to read the 26
> uppercase and 26 lowercase letters. The test will be administered on
> an individual basis. Students' performance on the 52 letters will be
> partitioned into the six forms of the Q-LNK Assessment. The
> correlation between the original and recalculated data will be
> performed to examine whether the Q-LNK Assessment is suitable for
> applying as an effective alphabet assessment which can be made of good
> use by English teachers who are carrying out the alphabet instruction.
> In addition, performance on the six forms will be compared to see
> whether the six forms yield similar scores in the English L2 children.

3.3 Instrument

The instrument for collecting data is the letter name knowledge
assessment. The assessment includes two sections. The first section
contains 26 uppercase letters in random order. The second section
contains 26 lowercase letters, again, in random order. The two sections
are printed on the same page. Each letter item is preceded by a number
to prevent the participants from missing or skipping the test items. The
assessment is designed in five versions, each version will be printed on
different color sheets (white, red, yellow, green, and blue) so that the
test administrators can easily identify the five versions. The letter
orders on each color sheet are also different in case the test causes
the fatigue effect. If only one version is adopted as the instrument for
all participants, due to the fatigue effect, the participants would feel
tired at the end of the assessment and affect the assessment
performance. The letters which fall at the back of the assessment will
get a lower score than those fall at the front of the assessment. In
order to avoid the fatigue effect, make a different version by
rearranging the letter order is necessary. See Appendix 1 for the five
versions of the assessment. The assessment contains a record sheet and a
student sheet. If the participant accepts the white sheet, the test
administrator will use the white record sheet to record the
participant's responses. The record sheet has a similar format with the
student's sheet and with a score blank in each section. See Appendix 2.

3.4 Procedures

> The participants will be given a letter name knowledge assessment of
> the 52 letters individually. The students\' English names will be
> recorded. The students will be shown on the sheet (Appendix 1). The
> test administrator will ask participants their English names and ask
> them to spell out their English names. If the participant cannot spell
> their names, then the administer help them spell the names and mark X
> following their names. If the participants do not have English names,
> then the test administrator will write down "No Name" in the name
> blank.
>
> After the test administer record the information about the
> participant's name the administer will ask the participant to point
> the first column of letters and say the name. If the participant
> cannot say the name, he or she can say "I don't know," skip the
> letter, and proceed to name the next letter. If the participant says
> the letter sounds rather than the letter administrator test administer
> will direct the participant to name the letter, by saying "Please say
> its name." When giving the assessment, the administrator will read the
> test item number and make sure that the participant follows the test
> items one by one. Three seconds are given for each test item for which
> the participant shows hesitation in naming. The test administers need
> to record the responses made by the participant on the record sheet
> (Appendix 2). If the participant gives an incorrect name, the
> incorrect name will be recorded. Each item is given one point if it is
> named accurately.

3.5 Data Analysis (unfinished)

> The examination of whether the Q-LNK Assessment estimates how many
> uppercase and lowercase letters do the participants know, firstly, we
> will sum up the score of 52 letters name knowledge. Secondly, we will
> fill out the Q-LNK Score Sheet (six forms) according to the data of 52
> letters name knowledge collecting from the participants and then
> calculate the total score of each form. Lastly, check each form's
> total score of Q-LNK Score Sheet and the expected total letter known
> chart, contrast with the collecting data, the score of 52 letters name
> knowledge. To check if the expected total letter known chart estimates
> the participants' real 52 letters name knowledge.
