Power is the truth, the wealthiest and noble families dominate everything, a humble learner who was born low can only come into low socioeconomic status without making good winning and achieve the dreams.




Talented people are not good flattery and the most talented people of the country were not being for the treasure, but was random trample.



Although people of insight and the sage have a clear understanding of the reality, but alone and hard to be support, they are powerless and helpless because the high socioeconomic status, the wealthiest and noble families, the powerful political families are too many and too strong.




Sage tentatively respect law-abiding to give up the idea of saving the world and people by themselves because it is destined to come to nothing.




But these are troubled times and many people are only for the sake and self-pity of their life. Better an egg in peace than an ox in war. It is a wise man who don't be a hero or sage.
