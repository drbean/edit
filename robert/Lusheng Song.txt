Power is absolutely the truth. The wealthiest and noble families dominate everything. Humble learners who are born low can only continue in a low socioeconomic status, not making good, winning and achieving their dreams.




Talented people are not good flatterers and the most talented people of the country are not treasured, but randomly trampled on.



Although people of insight and the sage have a clear understanding of reality, they are alone and unsupported. They are powerless and helpless because those of high socioeconomic status, the wealthiest and noble families, the powerful political families are too many and too strong.




The sage tentatively respects the law and gives up the idea of saving the world and people themselves because such acts are destined to come to nothing.




But these are troubled times and many people act only on the basis of self-pity and for the sake of their own lives. Better an egg in peace than an ox in war. It is a wise man who chooses not to be a hero or sage.
