                      Autobiography   
		      V9941010 , Robert Tang

		      My name is Robert Tang, I was born on 11 October 1968. I have long hoped to become a university student and I have been studying in the Department of Applied Foreign Languages at NUU that this year I will achieve the goal. As a student of the Department of Applied Foreign Languages is interested in literature to develop my extracurricular reading that couldn’t be better more. First of all, Mr. D.H. Lawrence is my favorite English writer, I can quote his article for impromptu writing to you: 


		      “Ours is essentially a tragic age, so we refuse to take it tragically. The cataclysm has happened, we are among the ruins, we start to build up new little habitats, to have new little hopes. It is rather hard work: there is now no smooth road into the future: but we go round, or scramble over the obstacles. We’ve got to live, no matter how many skies have fallen.”


		      How wonderful an essay is! What an emotional squib! Besides, after I said that, I tried to develop my speciality. I am also interested in international relations and politics even though I am to reach top achievement especially in eastern Asia region. For instance the military crises of Diaoyu Islands and Southern China sea have been found by me at first time in Taiwan’s academy circle. I offer them many methods to face the military crises. Finally, everyone has strengths and weaknesses, I couldn’t agree with that more. For instance, I am very indecisive why it usually let me down, this is one of my faults that always have a hard time making decisions. As mentioned previously, it is really a biography of sincerely amazing.
