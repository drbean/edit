                      Autobiography   
		      V9941010 , Robert Tang

		      My name is Robert Tang. I was born on 11 October 1968. I haD long hoped to become a university student and I have been studying in the Department of Applied Foreign Languages at NUU, EXPECTING that this year I will achieve the goal OF GRADUATION. As a student of the Department of Applied Foreign Languages, I COULDN’T HAVE A BETTER OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP MY INTEREST IN LITERATURE BY EXTRACURRICULAR READING. First of all, Mr. D.H. Lawrence is my favorite English writer. I can quote his article for impromptu writing to you: 

		      “Ours is essentially a tragic age, so we refuse to take it tragically. The cataclysm has happened, we are among the ruins, we start to build up new little habitats, to have new little hopes. It is rather hard work: there is now no smooth road into the future: but we go round, or scramble over the obstacles. We’ve got to live, no matter how many skies have fallen.”


		      How wonderful an essay THIS is! What an emotional FIRECRACKER! Besides, after .. that, I trY to develop my specialitIES. I am also interested in international relations and politics even though I STILL AIM to reach THE top IN achievement especially in THE eastern Asia region. For instance I WAS IN THE FOREFRONT OF RECOGNITION OF the military crises of THE Diaoyu Islands and Southern China sea .. in TaiwanESE academIC circleS. I offer them many methods to face the military crises. Finally, everyone has strengths and weaknesses, I couldn’t agree with that more. For instance, I am very indecisive. THIS usually letS me down. This is one of my faults. I always have a hard time making decisions. As mentioned previously, it is really SIMPLY AN amazing LIFE.
