## Self-evaluation

The good writer is always thinking about how the essay is going.

Ask yourself, Am I enjoying myself?

It's creative. You're building something. Have fun.

Here is a list of things to keep in your mind (in order of importance):

1. _Content_ (ie, your ideas)
1. _Organization_ (ie, ordering your ideas so that the reader can understand them, and see the connections between them, easily)
1. _Vocabulary_ (ie, the words you use)
1. _Grammar_ (ie, putting the words together following the rules of English)
1. _Spelling and mechanics_ (ie, spacing, punctuation, etc)

Can you think about 2. Organization, without forgetting about 4. Grammar?
Can you think about 3. Vocabulary without forgetting about 1. Content?

It's difficult! You have to keep the five things in mind continually while you write the essay.

Here, from an unidentified textbook, is a list of questions about organization you should be asking yourself as you write:

* I understand the different levels of importance of my ideas.
* I am summarizing my paper at the end and/or beginning.
* I am using because, so, therefore. (I am giving reasons.)
* I am making lists (with first, finally, also.)
* I am making generalizations, but avoiding overgeneralizations.
* I am using a rubric (textbook or teacher's instructions) to evaluate my writing.
* I am writing the right number of words.
