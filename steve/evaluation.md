## Self-evaluation

The good writer is always thinking about how the essay is going.

Ask yourself, Am I enjoying myself?

It's creative. You're building something. Have fun.

### Checklist of things to keep in mind

Here is a list of things to keep in your mind (in order of importance):

1. _Content_ (ie, your ideas)
1. _Organization_ (ie, ordering your ideas so that the reader can understand them, and see the connections between them, easily)
1. _Vocabulary_ (ie, the words you use)
1. _Grammar_ (ie, putting the words together following the rules of English)
1. _Spelling and mechanics_ (ie, spacing, punctuation, etc)

Can you think about 2. Organization, without forgetting about 4. Grammar?
Can you think about 3. Vocabulary without forgetting about 1. Content?

It's difficult! You have to keep the five things in mind continually while you write the essay.

### Organization checklist

Here, from an unidentified textbook, is a list of questions about organization you should be asking yourself as you write:

* I understand the different levels of importance of my ideas.
* I am summarizing my paper at the end and/or beginning.
* I am using because, so, therefore. (I am giving reasons.)
* I am making lists (with first, finally, also.)
* I am making generalizations, but avoiding overgeneralizations.
* I am using a rubric (textbook or teacher's instructions) to evaluate my writing.
* I am writing the right number of words.

### \citet{langan}'s bases for evaluating essays.

#### Is it unified?

Did you go off on a tangent? Graphic

Did you change the subject?

#### Is the point you want to make supported?

You have a purpose for writing. You want to convince the reader of something. But do you have support (evidence) for your point.

The best kind of support is a story, something that is real.

Think about it this way:

- Abstract - ideas, your point (in the present tense)
- Concrete - real, a story (in the past tense)

Both are important
