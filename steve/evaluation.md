## Self-evaluation

The good writer is always thinking about how the essay is going.

Ask yourself, Am I enjoying myself?

It's creative. You're building something. Have fun.

Here is a list of things you should think about (in order of importance):

 Content
 Organization
 Vocabulary
 Grammar
 Spelling and mechanics (ie, spacing, punctuation, etc)

Here, from an unidentified textbook, is a list of questions about organization you should be asking yourself as you write:

 I understand the different levels of importance of my ideas.
 I am summarizing my paper at the end and/or beginning.
 I am using because, so, therefore. (I am giving reasons.)
 I am making lists (with first, finally, also.)
 I am making generalizations, but avoiding overgeneralizations.
 I am using a rubric (textbook or teacher's instructions) to evaluate my writing.
 I am writing the right number of words.
