## The problem of shopping

Shopping can be fun but it also can be stressful, especially when you are going to spend a lot of money and have never bought a particular product before.

Even shopping at 7-11 or Family Mart can be confusing. There are many similar items available. How do you choose which one to buy? There may be too much (or too little) information available as you look at the items to allow you to make a decision you can feel comfortable with.

Market researchers study the reasons for (and consequences of) consumer confusion. But we are not interested in a scientific understanding of consumer behavior. We are just going to do a detailed personal report of our experience and our feelings buying one product last week/month.

## Format of essay

We are going to use the ``scientific'' IMRD format to write our report, even though the experiment/experience we are writing about is personal.

Some things that we say will be statements of facts, ie, are true or not. These are *objective*. Other things that we say will be opinions, or feelings, or judgements. These may be good or bad, but they can't be said to be true or false. They are *subjective*.

Suppose someone is going to write about buying small gas cylinders for a portable gas stove to cook rice on at QuanLian.

A.  Objective

Their example: ``I went to 全聯 to buy some gas cylinders for my portable gas stove.''

Your examples: 1. \hrulefill \
\hrulefill \
2. \hrulefill \
\hrulefill

B.  Subjective

Their example: ``I like 全聯.''

Your examples: 1. \hrulefill \
\hrulefill \
2. \hrulefill \
\hrulefill

The ojective statements are commonly about actions, things that the person did, that can be confirmed by witnesses, people who saw him/her at 全聯 that day. The subjective statements are not that kind of statement. They could be ideas or generalizations that other people will disagree with, or personal feelings that are difficult for other people to confirm.

## Essay outline

1.  Introduction: Why this topic? What have I and other people done and said? Mostly SUBJECTIVE

    Using a small portable gas stove to cook rice. Needing to buy gas cans from time to time.

2.  Method: The interaction with the store clerks. OBJECTIVE

		I couldn't find any gas cans. One clerk showed me, but I
		couldn't find them

		Clerk: They're over there.

		I looked and asked a second clerk.

		Me: Can you tell me where the gas cans are?

		She showed me. There were only 2 left.

		Me: Oh.

3.  Results: My feelings while buying the gas cans. What I did with the gas. OBJECTIVE and SUBJECTIVE

    Water. Rice.

4.  Discussion: What I think about cooking rice with gas, about shopping and about 全聯. SUBJECTIVE

This is not a very interesting report. What was the effect that the 
shopper was expecting? Did the shopper get the effect that was expected? 
Is the shopper happy with the result of the shopping experience?

These questions are not answered.
