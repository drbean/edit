## The problem of shopping

Shopping can be fun but it also can be stressful, especially when you are going to spend a lot of money and have never bought a particular product before.

Even shopping at 7-11 or Family Mart can be confusing. There are many similar items available. How do you choose which one to buy? There may be too much (or too little) information available as you look at the items to allow you to make a decision you can feel comfortable with.

Market researchers study the reasons for (and consequences of) consumer confusion. But we are not interested in a scientific understanding of consumer behavior. We are just going to do a detailed personal report of our experience and our feelings buying one product last week/month.
