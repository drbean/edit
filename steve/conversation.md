## Writing as conversation

People have been speaking to each other for as long as they have been on the earth, ie, 50,000 years. Writing has only existed for the last ten percent of that time. It was developed only in the last 5-7,000 years. But it allowed people who were separated by time and place to "speak" to each other. However, the reader cannot "talk back." The writer cannot hear what the reader thinks. We can "hear" what Confucius, Zhangzhi, the Buddha and Jesus said, but when we say, "Mmh-hmm," or "I disagree," they cannot hear.

In a conversation the participants cooperate to make communication successful. The way that a listener reacts to what a speaker says tells the speaker whether the conversation is going successfully or not. In writing, the reaction of the reader still determines whether the writing is successful or not, but the writer does not know what this reaction is, because there is no feedback from the reader. Writing is like a conversation with someone who is dumb and cannot speak. This is difficult. Have you ever had that kind of conversation where the other person doesn't say anything? You not only have to do your part in the conversation, you have to play the other person's part too.

The writer has to imagine what the reader is thinking. The writer has to have a feeling for who the audience is and what they want to hear from the writer. The writer must always ask, What question might the reader ask about what I said last? This should determine what the writer writes next. The writer should try to answer that imagined question.

As the title, '\currenttitle' says, think of writing as a conversation.
