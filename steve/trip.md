	1. How did you come to this plan? What were the reasons for it? Were they good? Who did you talk to about it?

		* the *reasons* behind a design decision. Ask, Why did I have to make this decision?
		* the *evaluation* for it. Ask, Why was it a good decision?

		* the *trade offs*. Ask, What were the advantages and disadvantages of all my options?
		* the *talk* that led to the decision. Ask, What did I say and who did I talk to as I tried to decide what to do?

2. Now imagine you have returned from the trip. It wasn't as you expected. Say how it was different than you expected.

	1. Re-evaluate your plan, the *reasons*, the *evaluation*, the *other alternatives*, the *trade offs*, the *talk*.

	2. What actually happened? The people, the things, the food, the places to stay, the events. Use your imagination.
