Talking to people, asking them questions and writing up their answers in an *Opinion Survey report* is a common activity in business and government. It is also easy to do in the IMRAD format, although it is not Action Research.

## Survey topics

* Names
* Music
* Shopping

## Plan of work
	
* At home

1. In the first week, 3 questions with 3 answers each.
2. In the second week, Interview 3 people with the 3 questions and 3 answers 
3. In the third week, Write-up of

	- Method, ie the questions, and  the people to interview, and
	- Results, ie what the people said.

3. In the fourth week, Write-up of

	- Introduction, ie why this survey topic was chosen, and
	- Discussion, ie what the results of the survey mean.

* In class

1. In the first week, motivating the survey essay
2. In the second week, reports on homework, ie

	- who was interviewed and
	- what they said

3. In the third week, ...

## 3 questions, 3 answers, 3 interviewees

Reporting the method and results:

- In groups, listen to the reports of your partners. What do you think their data shows? Ask them questions.
- As individuals tell the class and the teacher the questions you asked, and what the people said. What do you think your data shows? Ask the reporters questions.

## Class survey

* Everyone responds to everyone else's survey

	* Don't give the same answer as everyone else. Be different.

	* Don't take a lot of care, as there is no time. We should not take more than 15 minutes to answer the 40 questions.

		* Guess the meaning if you don't understand the question.

* Everyone writes up the class's responses using the IMRAD format.

	* How are the results from your classmates the same/different than the results you wrote up for homework?

* Include the four titles:

	* Introduction
	* Method
	* Results
	* Discussion

* If you were not here from Week 14 and did not do the survey, write about where you were those weeks on Saturday

* Saturday, December 12,
* Saturday, December 19,
* Saturday, December 26,
* Saturday, January 2,

	What were you doing, and why was it more important than being in class?

### A survey, where you find out the opinions that people have to some music that you are interested in.

Write it as an IMRAD report.

1) Introduction: Why did you choose this music? What do you want to find out
from these other people about their opinions of this music? What do you EXPECT
them to say to you? Will they agree with your opinions about the music? What
will you feel if they agree OR disagree? Why is this an interesting survey to
carry out?

Why did you choose the 3 questions you chose? What are your possible answers to
your 3 questions?

I asked you to choose people whose ideas about the music might be different to
yours. How did you choose the people to ask? Why are their opinions important?
What will 3 people's opinions tell you about everyone's opinions?

2) Method

i. 3 questions and 3 answers
ii. Tell me something about those people.
iii. When and where did you talk to them? What was the atmosphere?

3) Results

A table of the answers to the short questions. And (if possible) get them to
talk freely about the tracks you played. The longer the results section, the
better. Try to copy down what they said. If you can't remember, paraphrase what
they said.

4) Discussion

How were their ideas different than you expected and different than your ideas?
What do the results of the survey mean for you? Can you generalize from the
specific results you got to a general statement about all people and/or about
all the music by this artist, and/or about all music of the genre played by the
artist.

What do you think about music? What music will you play for people next time?
What questions will you ask?

        - Remember whether to ask a WH-question or YN-question, how may
          questions to ask, and how many people to ask.


### Rewrite your goals as questions for an opinion survey.
