# IMRAD: a ``scientific'' format

The format for much scientific writing nowadays is IMRAD.

IMRAD is 

1. *I*ntroduction--Why you did it or will do it.
2. *M*ethod--What you did/will do.
3. *R*esults--What happened when you did it.
4. *D*iscussion--What you think about the experience.

As you can see, it is similar to the process of Action Research, trying to see if what you are doing has an effect. This is why it is used in scientific writing.

But also, it is similar to the process of telling a story, where there may not be an intention of the people in the story to have an effect.

A story has a beginning, a middle, and an end.

* In the beginning we get the *background*.
* In the middle, the *scene*, or situation, is set up. It is uncertain what will happen. Will it end happily or unhappily?
* Then, we hear *what happened*. Towards the end, there is a *climax*, a happy,or unhappy event, ending the story.
* After the climax, the writer may end with a *moral*, telling us what we can learn from the story.

## Difficulties with the IMRAD format

### Confusing *Method* and *Results*

When we are writing an account of something we have already done living our lives: It is difficult to keep *Method* (what we did) and *Results* (what happened when we did it) separate in our minds. It is easier if we think of *Method* and *Results* as the telling of a story. *Method* is what happened first and not so exciting. *Results* is what happened at the end and the most exciting part.

## Examples

### Good introductions--Which introduction gives you a better idea of the questions which will be asked?

I designed three couple questions because I wanted to know other people think about couples' interaction. I think everyone may also want to know it too. 

I designed about travel issues.People travel area,travel days.most want to travel with who.I can know more travel information.

### Introductions--Sentence fragments, run-on sentences, comma splices

The questionnaire of the time in the beginning of December 7, the introduction is life goals. The first time in the December 8 I said to my boyfriend asked my questionnaire, this questionnaire want to know Now people about the future of life and time is how to plan for themselves what is hope. My idea whether there are differences with others.

1. The questionnaire of the time in the beginning of December 7, the introduction is life goals. 

	a. The questionnaire of the time in the beginning of December 7

		- Correct sentence (C)
		- Sentence fragment (SF)
		- Run-on sentence (RO)

	b. The questionnaire of the time in the beginning of December 7, the introduction is life goals.

This is the first time I tried to do the questionnaire feel very fresh, the final selection of gift themes

In addition to personal gifts you can have in mind, but also to receive a gift of surprise, excitement, the method most representative mind. My friend also said that agree with this view

## Additional essays

### A story that reveals something about your personality

Tell about an event where something happened to you, or you did something that would be interesting to a reader. What does it tell about you?

The defining characteristic of a story is that it takes place over time, 0ne or more years, one or more days, or one or more seconds. This characteristic requires the story teller to accurately recall the different parts of the story and to understand how they are related.

* Background--Information about what had happened before the event took place.
* The scene--Like in a movie, things take place in scenes. Answer Who, What, When, Where questions about the scene.
* What happened--Like in a movie, there is a happy/sad climax and ending.
* Moral--What is the meaning of the event? What does it show about you? What did you learn? What happened at other times afterward?

Include the 4 titles: Background, The scene, What happened/climax, Moral

An alternative structure is that of \citet{folse}.

* The background: What the story is about
* The beginning: the action starts, or the problem or conflict is explained
* The middle: the main action occurs
* The end: the final action occurs with a happy or sad ending, or the solution to the problem/conflict appears.

The two structures are very similar, differing only in details.
