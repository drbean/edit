# IMRD: a ``scientific'' format

The format for much scientific writing nowadays is IMRD.

IMRD is 

1. *I*ntroduction--Why you did it or will do it.
2. *M*ethod--What you did/will do.
3. *R*esults--What happened when you did it.
4. *D*iscussion--What you think about the experience.

As you can see, it is similar to the process of Action Research, trying to see if what you are doing has an effect. This is why it is used in scientific writing.

But also, it is similar to the process of telling a story, where there may not be an intention of the people in the story to have an effect.

A story has a beginning, a middle, and an end.

* In the beginning we get the *background* and the *scene* is set.
* In the middle, we hear *what happened*.
* Towards the end, there is a *climax*, a happy,or unhappy event, ending the story.
* After the climax, the writer may end with a *moral*, telling us what we can learn from the story.

Background/scene               =                  Introduction          

What happened                  =                  Method                

Climax (un/happy end)          =                  Results               

Moral                          =                  Conclusion/discussion
