# Exams and writing in class

Each class will have different rules for exams and writing in class (as a graded activity):

One of the authors' rules are:

* DO NOT use notes, dictionaries, books
* DO talk to each other
* DO use other classmates, teacher's knowledge
* DO read each others' essays
* DO write in your NOTEBOOK
* DO double space your writing
* 

Remember, Westerners don't like white-out fluid, especially on hand-written essays. Crossing out, additions are exciting to the teacher. White-out puts a false face on your work.

After one hour and again half an hour before the end, we will *stand up*, *leave* our essay on the desk and *walk around* and *look* at other students' essays. *Pick* them *up* and *read* them.

Take note of the teacher's grading system. The exams may be worth a smaller percentage of the grade than the essays written for homework.

If there are two essays, better than writing a great first essay and not writing a second essay at all is writing a so-so first one and a so-so second one.

If there is no second essay, the maximum points for it can only be zero, for an

	average grade of 100 percent + 0 percent = 50 percent,

put probably less than 50 percent. If there are two so-so essays, the grade would be something like

	the average of 60 percent + 60 percent = 60 percent,

which is better than 50 percent.
