# Exams and writing in class

Each class will have different rules for exams and writing in class (as a graded activity):

One of the authors' rules are:

* DO NOT use notes, dictionaries, books
* DO talk to each other
* DO use other classmates, teacher's knowledge
* DO read each others' essays
* DO write in your NOTEBOOK
* DO double space your writing
* 

Remember, Westerners don't like white-out fluid, especially on hand-written essays. Crossing out, additions are exciting to the teacher. White-out puts a false face on your work.

After one hour and again half an hour before the end, we will *stand up*, *leave* our essay on the desk and *walk around* and *look* at other students' essays. *Pick* them *up* and *read* them.

Take note of the teacher's grading system. The exams may be worth a smaller percentage of the grade than the essays written for homework.
