## Writing as a way of thinking

Have you ever had the experience of deciding what to say as you write? Perhaps you don't think you have any good ideas, but when you start to write and see what you have written, more ideas come to you. Writing down the first sentence makes you think of more ideas.

Reading what other people have written about a topic can give us our own ideas about the topic. Reading what *we* have written can also give us ideas. We know what we wrote, but when we read it, it appears to have come from a different source, even though it came from ourselves. It makes us think of ideas we wouldn't have thought of, if we hadn't written it down. We are giving ourselves ideas, sharing ideas with ourselves.

We are reacting to what we wrote ourselves. We cannot do this if it is not written down, just by sitting and thinking. By putting it down on paper and looking at it as if someone else wrote it, we see new ideas and can compare these new ideas with our old ideas.

Writing is a way of thinking, a way of developing our thoughts. When writing, we are not just transfering ideas from our head to paper. It's like we are having a conversation with ourselves, a conversation which is giving us new ideas. Not the kind of conversation we are pretending to have with our readers. See [Writing as Conversation](#writing-as-conversation) in [A Writer's Tool Box](#a-writers-toolbox). In that kind of conversation, no actual response is coming from the readers. This kind of conversation we are having with ourselves is a real conversation, where we give our attention to what we see on the page in ways that we can't when we are just hearing it in our heads.
