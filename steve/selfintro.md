## Johari Window on self

The Johari Window compares and contrasts what you know/DON'T know (or think) about yourself with what others know/DON'T know (or think) about you.

You will be writing about the person you know best, yourself.

But do you know yourself best? Or, do others know you better than you know yourself?
