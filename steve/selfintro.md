## Johari Window on self

The Johari Window compares and contrasts what you know/DON'T know (or think) about yourself with what others know/DON'T know (or think) about you.

You will be writing about the person you know best, yourself.

But do you know yourself best? Or, do others know you better than you know yourself?

## The open self, the hidden self, the unknown self and the blind self

The *open self* is things that the self is aware of and others are aware of too. For example, Greg Matheson is something of a perfectionist. He knows it and his students know it. It is *open.*

The *hidden self* is things that the self is aware of but others perhaps are not aware of. For example, Greg Matheson doesn't like to spend money. He knows it, but his students/friends don't know it. He keeps this part of his self private, or *hidden.*

The *blind self* is things that the self is not aware of, but others know about. For example, Greg Matheson was surprised to be told that he doesn't stand straight up, when he is walking. He was not aware that he was bending forward, walking like an old man. He was *blind* to that fact. As another example, his wife told him he is inflexible, or stubborn, and that he won't compromise with her, even though she makes compromises for his sake. This also surprised him because he considers himself very flexible.

The *unknown self* is things about the self that the self doesn't know and others don't know either. Greg Matheson would like to be a business man but he doesn't know if he has the ability to be a good business man and other people don't know either. Many of the reasons we do things are *unknown* by ourselves and others.

## Activity 1: Drawing your and your partners' Johari Windows

### What are you and your partners' characteristic?

In groups of three people who know each other, and who are happy working with each other, choose words in English and Chinese which describe A, B and C, ie, yourself and your partners. Write sentences if you can. Follow the example. Write 20 characteristics.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
      A                         B                      C
----------------------   -----------------------   -----------------
            tall                      dark                  handsome

            strong                    silent

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Table: Characteristics of the 3 people in the group

### Look at your partners' description of you.

* If you are surprised by what they said, then this is a characteristic of your *blind self*.
* If you are NOT surprised by what they said, then this is a characteristic of your *open self*.

### Compare their descriptions of you with your own description of yourself.

* If any of your descriptions were not also mentioned by your partners, then these are characteristic of your *hidden self*. 

### Draw your Johari window.

Table: Your Johari window

In your *unknown self*, put characteristics you would like to have, but don't know if you have or not. Perhaps you can develop these characteristics from resources inside you

### Important note: What has been said about you may not be true

Are your partners good judges of character? Are you a good judge of your own character? What they said about you and what you said about yourself may not be true. It may just be wishful thinking or you may be too critical of yourself.

## Activity 2: Questions from the audience

For the reasons given on \pref{writing-as-conversation} in \titleref{a-writers-toolbox}, writers need to have an understanding of what question readers want them to answer next. We are going to practice answering question from a reader when writing about ourselves.

### Arrangement of writers and readers

Everyone is in a circle and is consecutively a writer and a reader. Each person is writing for the person on their left. Each person is reading for the writer on their right. Readers will ask (actually, write) 20(!) questions about what the writer has written that they want the writer to answer. So, actually this is practice in thinking of questions about what someone else has written. However, it is what YOU would be doing if you were the person on your right.


### Writers write first 1-2 sentences using Johari window and/or other source

## Homework: 70 words about yourself

### Advice

#### Don't say, I have a mother and a father, X brothers and X sisters.

Everyone has a family. It's not interesting. Do you think the readers want to find out about your brothers and sisters? If you're not ready to answer questions about your brothers and sisters, (or if you're not ready to say more about your relationship with them), don't mention them.

At this moment, your brothers and sisters are probably writing the same words, ``I have X brothers and X sisters.'' What do they want to say about you? Probably nothing. Don't write about them.

#### Say how you are different

It's interesting to read how people are different than others. It's not interesting reading all the self-introductions when every person says the same thing. Try to be interesting.

#### Use your Johari window and mindmap

These are things you and other people have said. They can help you. You don't have to use all the information. Add ideas that you think are better than the ones in the Johari window and mindmap.

#### an author's mindmap

### Example self-introduction

Here is the self-introduction one of the authors wrote using his mindmap.

#### an author's mindmap

### Example self-introduction

Here is the self-introduction one of the authors wrote using his mindmap.

    I came to Taiwan to learn Chinese and teach English, but I fell out 
    of love with natural language and fell in love with computer 
    languages. Well, I didn't really fall out of love with Chinese. I am 
    still grateful when people give me a chance to talk to them in 
    Chinese. But I devote very little time to learning it. I spend all 
    my time on the computer when I am not teaching developing computer 
    apps. Writing computer programs is easier than teaching English. The 
    students don't do what I want, but I can get the computer to do what 
    I want. It is fun to meet a problem when writing code, and be able 
    to find a solution. The students, on the other hand, challenge the 
    image I have of myself of being a person who is effective. The 
    students make feel ineffective. The cognitive conflict drives me 
    harder.

    Still, I love Taiwan, and intend to stay here for the immediate 
    future, even though my wife went back to Japan. The Japanese are 
    over-regimented and she didn't like the "loose" attitude to rules in 
    Taiwan. I like that actually. Although, I wish Taiwanese drivers 
    would follow the rules of the road more carefully. I ride a bicycle 
    and I fear being killed by a young motorcycle rider running a red 
    light. I love bicycles. I don't like motorcycles.
