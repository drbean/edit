## Johari Window on self

The Johari Window compares and contrasts what you know/DON'T know (or think) about yourself with what others know/DON'T know (or think) about you.

You will be writing about the person you know best, yourself.

But do you know yourself best? Or, do others know you better than you know yourself?

## The open self, the hidden self, the unknown self and the blind self

Things about self that SELF: & Knows & Open self & Hidden self  \\

The *open self* is things that the self is aware of and others are aware of too. For example, Greg Matheson is something of a perfectionist. He knows it and his students know it. It is *open.*

The *hidden self* is things that the self is aware of but others perhaps are not aware of. For example, Greg Matheson doesn't like to spend money. He knows it, but his students/friends don't know it. He keeps this part of his self private, or *hidden.*

The *blind self* is things that the self is not aware of, but others know about. For example, Greg Matheson was surprised to be told that he doesn't stand straight up, when he is walking. He was not aware that he was bending forward, walking like an old man. He was *blind* to that fact.

The *unknown self* is things about the self that the self doesn't know and others don't know either. Greg Matheson would like to be a business man but he doesn't know if he has the ability to be a good business man and other people don't know either. Many of the reasons we do things are *unknown* by ourselves and others.
