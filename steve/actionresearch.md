\part{Action Research}

# Plan of work
	
* In class

1. Something you did: what happened, what do you think
2. Questions from the audience
3. Mind Maps

* At home

1. 3-4 paragraphs, 100 words about an attempt to do something
2. Essay on Internet, due Friday night, at the end of Week 4

* One more time

1. We do it all again, writing about the same thing, but using a "scientific" format, or writing about a different thing we did.

	But still:

	- Trying to do something,
	- seeing how it goes,
	- writing about it

# Rationale for an unusual kind of essay

\epigraphhead{\epigraph{Do.\\ Think.\\ Write.}{\textit{http://dothinkwrite.blogspot.com}}}

A.  Some things we do, it is difficult to see the effect of. For example, brushing your teeth.

    What is the effect of your brushing your teeth this morning? Was it good or not good? You can't see your teeth without a mirror. Even then, it is difficult to see your teeth, because they are hidden inside your mouth.

    We brush our teeth, not because of any effect we notice, but because we're supposed to brush them. Everyone brushes them. We think it is a good idea to brush them.

    We believe it stops tooth decay, but although we brush our teeth everyday, we still have holes in our teeth.

B.  Other things we do, we do by chance and we see a good result. For example, pieces of bread in fruit salad.

    Hey, pieces of bread in fruit salad tastes great. Like cake. The texture of bread suits the sweet fruit salad. Try it, you'll like it.

    You didn't have any idea of creating a new recipe. Someone suggested it, or you had an extra slice of dry bread and you just tore it up and put it in some fruit salad you were eating. You weren't trying out a new recipe.

C.  Okay. A lot of our actions are like that. We do things:

    A.  because we are supposed to, or everyone does it, or it is a rule, and we don't real know what the result is.

	    Studying at school is like that. *Life* is like that. Or,

    B.  for no reason at all, by chance, unthinkingly. Or,
    C.  we do things because we want to see what the effect is.

All these 3 ways of doing things are good ways to do things, but A. and B. are difficult to talk about. Let's talk and write about C.

This last way of doing things, with an idea about what we want to do, and where we expect an effect, can be called Action Research. In this part, we will be writing essays about what we have done, or what we intend to do, to have an effect.

To do that,

1. think of something risky, where we are not too sure if there is going to be an effect or not, or if the effect is going to be good or not, 
2. do it
3. think about the effect
4. write it up:
	
	i. the idea
	ii. what we did
	iii. what was the effect
	iv. what did we learn

Remember: Everyone likes to be successful, to achieve what they set out to achieve, but ..

Being successful is important, but ..

1. Your essay may be more interesting if you are unsuccessful.
2. The teacher won't give you a higher grade if your idea worked. Your grade will be higher if you analyze the results of what you did more.
3. You have more to analyze if the results were not what you expected.

# Writing up a self-chosen goal activity

An introduction to an attempt to do something simple

50 words on:

1. Why is this goal a simple goal but something you want to see happen?
2. What is your experience with doing this in the past?
3. What do you hope is the outcome when you do this thing? 

20 keywords when you did something simple:

Divide the keywords into 3 sections: Method, Results, Discussion 

## Oh, no! We didn't achieve what we wanted to achieve!

It didn't work!

If it did, imagine it didn't.

Write up the Introduction, Method, Results, Discussion.
