## Johari Window on self

The Johari Window compares and contrasts what you know/think about yourself and what you DON'T know/think about yourself with what others know/think and don't know/think about you.

Writing about the person you know best, yourself.

But do you know yourself best? Or, do others know you better than you know yourself?
