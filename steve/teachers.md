## How much writing? What is the writing worth?

The authors actually do little writing in class, unless in a computer lab. However they have the students in some weeks, eg, week 4, 9, 13 and 18 spend the whole of the class time writing essays, effectively lessening the distinction between the midterm and final exams and informal writing-in-class experiences. As a result, they have 3 or 4 tests to include in their assessment schedule (instead of the traditional 2). One possibility would be to make each test worth 10 points for a total of 40 percent of the grade.

Instead of having students write in class, they assign writing homework more often than in most writing classes, having them write an assessed essay in a notebook or on a class wiki every second week or so. If each of these essays were worth 5 points, for a total of 40 percent of the grade, the homework would have equivalent weight to that of the exams. Traditionally, homework contributes much less to the grade.

## The process approach

The final 20 percent would be for classwork. The reason the authors don't do much writing in class, at least with lower-level students, is that with them, they have rarely been successful in a process approach in their classes, even though they believe it is theoretically the correct way to teach composition.
