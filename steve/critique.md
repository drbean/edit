# Design criticism

## An exercise in critiquing a design--Developing a critical understanding of a set of design decisions

Take something into which a designer or a set of designers have put a lot of work. It will be something about which the designers thought a lot about their design, and made many decisions.

It will be a topic about which you know a lot, and have a strong interest.

It could be an:

1. architectural design
2. graphic design
3. educational design, (eg the school's language teaching program)
4. a cooking recipe
5. fashion design

What is good/not good about the design? Try to understand WHY the designers made the decisions they made.

How would you have done it? What decisions would you have made?

## Design decisions

5 things to think about when looking back at your design

* the *reasons* behind a design decision. Ask, Why did you have to make this decision?
* the *justification* for it. Ask, Why was it a good decision?
* the *other alternatives* considered. Ask, What choices did you have at that time?
* the *trade offs* evaluated. Ask, What were the advantages and disadvantages of your options?
* the *argumentation* that led to the decision. Ask, What went through my mind as I tried to decide what to do?

## An exercise critiquing your own design decisions

Go back to the IMRAD essay you wrote about taking a trip on \pageref{63}. See [Additional Essays](#additional-essays) in [A Trip](#a-trip). 

Rewrite that as a design decision. Think about the 5 elements of a design decision.
