# Design criticism

## An exercise in critiquing a design--Developing a critical understanding of a set of design decisions

Take something into which a designer or a set of designers have put a lot of work. It will be something about which the designers thought a lot about their design, and made many decisions.

It will be a topic about which you know a lot, and have a strong interest.

It could be an:

1. architectural design
2. graphic design
3. educational design, (eg the school's language teaching program)
4. a cooking recipe
5. fashion design

What is good/not good about the design? Try to understand WHY the designers made the decisions they made.

How would you have done it? What decisions would you have made?

## An exercise critiquing your own design decisions

5 things to think about when looking back at your design

* the reasons behind a design decision,
* the justification for it,
* the other alternatives considered,
* the trade offs evaluated, and
* the argumentation that led to the decision.
