## Example essay

Here is a report one of the authors wrote about visiting the US with his son:

	(One/Two or Three) Significant Things I Did this Summer

	(>100 words)

	One of the significant things I did this summer was to
	accompany my son to his university in San Francisco. It was
	the first time either of had been to San Francisco.  While I
	was only there for two days, we were productive with our
	time.

	Our flight arrived at the international airport by 8am, and
	we quickly got tickets to take the metro rail for the hour
	long trip to the motel at which we would stay for two
	nights.  Though we arrived early for check-in, the manager
	gave us a key for our bedroom so we could store our luggage.

	We then took a bus down to the campus to see if we could
	open a Citibank account. Unfortunately, the manager said we
	needed more information and that should make an appointment
	for the next day.  Despite this bad news, we went on to the
	campus to get Daniel’s photo ID and a statement for Taiwan’s
	military to prove that Daniel was a full-time student. If
	Daniel can’t prove he is a full-time student, the soldiers
	would drag Daniel off to become a soldier. Everyone was very
	helpful at the school, so we were very efficient in getting
	this information.  

	Next, we got a iPhone 6 for Daniel, to go with the iPad that
	Daniel’s uncle had given him as a graduation present.
	Daniel was thrilled.

### Example diary item

Here is a diary item one of the authors wrote about a busy weekend at church, and end-of-semester course grading:

\begin{verbatim}

                                                .... I just got over a big
hump with new high-intensity classes this past week.  Sunday I spoke on
honoring one's parents - 5th commandment (I believe it went ok in the large
congregation, though in the smaller 1:30 setting, some could have been
pared) I wrote most of it Saturday late afternoon and arose Sun morning ~
4:30 to complete. Ezra was my PPT guy, but there was some misunderstanding
Saturday night, so when he got up ~6:15 everything wasn't put together
right. Didn't get the review I wanted to do before leaving to print things
out ! 7:30. Anyway, Ezra helped as my PPT guy in the morning so it went
fairly smoothly - I'll see if it was recorded. In the afternoon he went
home to study for next semester. Serena was with her family moving the
family altar to the eldest brother's home.  Sunday afternoon I decompressed
and got up Mon @ 3:30 to put the grades together, as I was in pretty good
shape already about the aspects for the grades. Day grades were done by
8:17am, I and Ezra took the trash and recyclable to the morning drop off
site and I breathed easily. By 9:15 I went back to complete Night grades as
Ezra had spoken about the family going to see a movie around lunch time.
My grades were in by 11am.  Ezra changed the plan to evening as it might
press up against our getting to the buxiban early to prepare to teach.  In
the evening I saw reviews on his chosen movie, which had gotten low rotten
tomatoes and metacritics reviews. Seemed he was going to a movie just to go
out to a movie- we discussed that.  I suggested the animation The Secret
life of Pets that went from 9:05 (9:20) to ~ 11pm. We all liked it.  Got up
7:30, began my email and online news and website readings, and since began
prepping for classes.
