# Writing when the Action Research paradigm is not the right one

\epigraphhead{\epigraph{Design is what you are doing when you don't know what you are doing.}{\textit{George Stiny}}}

## Action Research and IMRAD is NOT the Answer

- People do not work this way – a lot of evidence has
demonstrated that people do not act as the IMRAD model
suggests ^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design].

People are unconscious of their methods, and do not pay attention to the results.

Especially in interaction with other people, we do not try to make sense of what happens by analyzing action and result.

Finding right tone for inputting 注音, I forget the tone immediately after.

- Unrealistic assumptions – goals are often unknown when a
project begins, and the requirements and constraints continue to
change. ^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design]

## Design is the Answer

1. people use creativity and emotion to generate designs.
2. the design process is improvised,
3. no fixed sequence of stages (like, IMRAD) exists – analysis, design and
	implementation happen at the same time and cannot be separated. ^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design]

## So, Taking Action, Suggesting Action

Let's rewrite the self-chosen Action Research project that we wrote up as an IMRAD article, as a design document, for others to follow.

## Design Document

What to tell others who will take action following our guidance

What it is in games:

## Design document structure

[Advice on a design document structure](https://bbrathwaite.wordpress.com/2008/11/30/creating-a-game-design-document/)

- A core statement
- A feature set
- A table of contents

## An outline for a document that other can follow to do (learn from or copy) what we have done/thought.

1. A core statement. 10-15 words explaining the problem area.  eg Dr Bean's core statement would be:

	'Developing techniques to manage classrooms where everyone is learning and students are on-task.'

2. 8-10 features of the design. eg for Dr Bean:

	Classroom, textbook, students, learning, task, punishment, reward, involvement, communication, language.

3. A table of contents with 5-6 items. eg for Dr Bean

	a. The circumstances of teacher and students as individuals, and the group as whole
	b. Motivating individuals to study
	c. Classroom management problems--differences according to the group
	d. Rewarding and punishing students
	e. Dealing with my personal stress and discomfort
	f. Radical (or traditional) activities that involve students
