## Whiteout

People in Taiwan use whiteout fluid (塗改液), a lot.

Westerners don't use whiteout a lot. The people who mostly use it are typists who are copying something someone else has written. When typists make a mistake in a letter they are going to send, they will white it out.

It is even against the law to make changes with whiteout in some documents. You are supposed to cross out the change and add your new change above or below it.

Teachers don't like students to use whiteout. They want to see what students wrote before they changed it. They want to understand why they changed what they wrote. They can't do that if they can't see what the students wrote first. And sometimes students' original choice is better than their second choice.

When students use whiteout, teachers think students are trying to hide things from them. The teachers think students who use whiteout are dishonest. They think the students are only concerned with appearances, or making a good impression, rather than saying what they really think.

So, don't use whiteout. Put a line through what you wrote and put your change above or below it, between the lines. Good writers will often double space their lines, so that they can easily add changes between the lines. Some will even triple space, so there are 2 blank lines between every line they write.

It looks messy, but writers using an alphabetic script aren't as concerned about the look of what they write as writers using Chinese characters are.
