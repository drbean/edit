## Plagiarism

Taking work from elsewhere and putting
it in your own essay WILL BE PUNISHED.
All material that you haven't written
yourself must be indicated and its
source referenced.

Paraphrasing is usually better than
direct quoting unless the LANGUAGE,
rather than the content, is important.
Of course, even when paraphrased,
content taken from another source is
ILLEGAL, unless the source is cited.
