## Plagiarism

Taking work from elsewhere and putting
it in your own essay WILL BE PUNISHED.
All material that you haven't written
yourself must be indicated and its
source referenced.

Paraphrasing is usually better than
direct quoting unless the LANGUAGE,
rather than the content, is important.
Of course, even when paraphrased,
content taken from another source is
ILLEGAL, unless the source is cited.

Where is the plagiarism here:

Since last Sunday morning, I saw the news about a sperm whale that was 
died and floated on the sea. Marine biologists from a local university, 
who conducted an autopsy over the weekend, found a mass of plastic bags 
and fishing net sizeable enough to fill an excavator bucket. Professor 
Wang Chien-ping, head of the Whale Research Centre at National Cheng-Kung 
University, said the garbage was probably a major factor in the death. 
This news makes me have an idea about how to clean our beach in Taiwan. 
And the only way that I can do is pick up a garbage from the beach even 
that wasn't I made.

The original article:

The 15-metre mature sperm whale was spotted stranded off the southern town of Tongshi on October 15.

Coastguards and scientists returned it to the ocean but three days later it was found dead around 20 kilometres away.

Marine biologists from a local university, who conducted an autopsy over the weekend, found a mass of plastic bags and fishing net sizeable enough to fill an excavator bucket.

Professor Wang Chien-ping, head of the Whale Research Centre at National Cheng-Kung University, said the garbage was probably a major factor in the death.

He said the whale could have suffered heart or lung disease and multiple infections.
