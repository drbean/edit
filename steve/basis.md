## The bases for evaluating essays. From Langan College Writing Skills (McGRaw-Hill)

### Is it unified?

Did you go off on a tangent? Graphic

Did you change the subject?

### Is the point you want to make supported?

You have a purpose for writing. You want to convince the reader of something. But do you have support (evidence) for your point.

The best kind of support is a story, something that is real.

Think about it this way:

- Abstract - ideas, your point (in the present tense)
- Concrete - real, a story (in the past tense)

Both are important
