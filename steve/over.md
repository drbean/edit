## The Discussion: Avoiding overgeneralizations

	Female students get better English grades than male students.

This is not strictly true. It is saying that:

	All female students get a better English grade than any male student.

That is, there is no boy who has a higher grade than a girl in English. In fact some boys get higher grades than some girls.

It may be *generally true*. *On average*, girls get higher grades than boys in English. But, to avoid people saying you are overgeneralizing, to avoid people giving you counter-examples, like, "Well, Jack here got a better grade than Jill. He's a boy and he's better than Jill," you can *hedge* by saying,

	Female students mostly get better English grades than male students.

Or,

	Female students tend to get better English grades than male students.

Or,

	More female students get good English grades than male students.

Generalizing is talking about *all* cases of something, when you only know about *some* cases. A generalization is a statement based on particular examples, but which talks about all possible examples.

You want to do that. People also want you to make generalizations and draw conclusions when you're reporting a study of something you did. For example, you studied the popularity of "Hello Kitty." You talked to some people about "Hello Kitty" and they all said they like "Hello Kitty." People want to know that everyone likes "Hello Kitty." You want to say,

	Everyone likes "Hello Kitty."

But this is an overgeneralization. Instead, say,

	On the basis of our research, we can say, Everyone likes "Hello Kitty."
