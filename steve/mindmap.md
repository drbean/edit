## Mind maps

Q: What is a mindmap?

A:

* A way of organizing ideas with arrows and lists in 2 dimensions. Or,
* Just some words on a page in no real order.

Q: How can a mindmap help me?

A: Writing not only allows you to find out what people a long time ago or a long way away said, it also allows you to find ideas which you had before but which you have now forgotten.
