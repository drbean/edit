## Mind maps

Q: What is a mindmap?

A:

* A way of organizing ideas with arrows and lists in 2 dimensions. Or,
* Just some words on a page in no real order.

Q: How can a mindmap help me?

A: It can remind you of ideas which you have forgotten. Writing is putting ideas down on paper. We have good ideas but we forget them. Then when it's time to write, our minds are blank and we have no good ideas. Try putting something you want to say down on paper as a mindmap. When it is time to write, you can use your mindmap as notes.

Q: What form should a mindmap take?

A: Any form is OK. It's just a way of helping you prepare for writing. The aim is not to make a mindmap. The aim is to write down good ideas that you may forget when it is time to write the essay. You can use Chinese or English, words or sentences, colors or no colors, pictures or language. It can be neat or messy, spread-out or just a list, connected by arrows or not connected by arrows, but the more there is in your mindmap the better.

Q: What are the arrows connecting words for?

A: Ideas are similar to each other or very different, or not connected. When you are writing, you will organize what you want to say. Ideas which are similar or very different will go together in what you write. The arrows can help you organize what you want to say.
