# Preface

Writing distinguishes the educated person from the uneducated person. When native speakers are forming an impression of your capability, your intelligence, your usefulness, what they see in your writing is much more important than what they hear you say.

So if you want to impress foreigners, forget about improving your conversation. Forget about improving your grammar, even. (Because you can always get a native speaker to correct the sentence-level grammar of your writing.) Instead, bring your ideas and their organization to a higher level. (Because native speaker editors cannot turn straw into gold. They *can* turn an ungrammatical sentence into a grammatical one. But they can*not* turn a lack of interesting ideas into interesting ideas. They can*not* reorganize your essay by changing all the sentences and moving them around.)

Having good ideas and working out how to put them down on paper is the most important thing you can do learning English at college. This makes this course the most important course you will take here.

When you put words on paper, you are creating a thing, just as much as you are when building a house, or cooking food. It doesn't have a shape or form, like a house, or food. But it is real. You are turning thoughts or ideas into something which is real. Computer apps are real. They turn logic and mathematics into things that give people power and have effects on them. And your writing is real, too. It can change other people's lives.
