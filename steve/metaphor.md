## Understanding how to write: Choosing a style

Experienced writers understand their style, or the way they write. They can change the way they write if the topic is difficult for them and the style they normally use isn't working for them.

Good writers think about how they write. They don't let the job of writing force them to think only about the topic and they don't let it force them to follow any one style.

\citet{chandler}'s description of writers as architects and bricklayers and Chinese painters and Western painters can help understanding of writing style.

A writer who follows the *architectural* approach doesn't use [Writing as a way of thinking] (see \pref{writing-as-a-way-of-thinking}). Architectural writers are like architects who plan every detail of a building before it is constructed. Architectural writers think prefer to stop and come back to the writing job later if they are having problems writing. They make a clear distinction between thinking and writing.

The *bricklayer* style also looks at writing as like building a house. Writers using the bricklayer style have to get every sentence, every paragraph right before they can move to the next sentence or paragraph. They have a clear idea of what they want to say. They don't think of [Writing as a way of thinking]. They are concentrating on how to say what they want to say. The bricklayer style may be combined with the architectural style, the bricklayer style being used as writers try to express thoughts in language using the bricklayer style that they have already prepared with the architectural style.

One of the authors has used the bricklayer style, writing this section.

Western painters painting oil paintings will use thick layers of paint on their paintings. Writers who write a lot of drafts and do a lot of revisions are like oil painters, following the *Western painting* approach. This approach is the opposite of the architectural approach. They do use [Writing as a way of thinking] (\pref{writing-as-a-way-of-thinking}). But they also will stop and come back to the writing job later. Writing on paper, they will do lots of editing. But, they really like writing using the computer. They think it makes them more productive.

Chinese ink painting, like Western watercolor painting, is the opposite of Western painting. The work has to be done quickly and once the ink has been brushed on the paper, it cannot be changed. Writers who follow the *Chinese painting* approach try quickly to finish and make only minor changes as they write. Bad writers follow this approach, and do no revision, but they produce work which is unsuccessful. Good writers may also write this way and produce work which is fresh and has feeling. Chinese painting writers don't prefer to use the computer over pencil and paper. They may have thought hard about what they want to say before they start writing, or they may just start writing.
