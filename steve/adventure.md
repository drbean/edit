## The problem of doing something

The idea is not to do something which is dangerous. That is, it is not a real adventure, or 冒險. The idea is to have an experience (經驗), the outcome of which we are not certain before the experience happens.

Because we are not certain of what is going to happen in this experience, it can be called an experiment (實驗). Although the word 'experiment' is often used for formal scientific research, you can also use it for informal life experiences where you are trying something out.

## Activity 1: Sharing a plan to do something/an experience doing something

In groups of three people, 

i. Tell stories of a plan to do something, or an experiment you undertook to do something of whose outcome you were not certain. 
ii. Describe the best possible outcome and the worst possible outcome.
iii. Choose the most interesting plan/experience with the most interesting (possible) consequences.
iv. Elect a spokesperson to report that plan/experience.

## Activity 2: Questions from the audience

As in [Activity 2: Questions from the audience] on \pref{activity-2-questions-from-the-audience}, we will prepare ideas for an essay and ask questions about others' ideas.

## Writing the essay

### Format of essay

We already wrote a similar essay about shopping using the IMRD format explained in [IMRD: a "scientific" format] on \pref{imrd-a-scientific-format} . This time the choice of topic is yours.

1.  Introduction: Why this topic? What have I and other people done and said? Mostly SUBJECTIVE

    How to eat lemons: Commonly, make lemonade, squeeze lemon juice on fish, or in tea. What about in fruit salad, or with bread?

2.  Method: The way I will eat lemons in fruit salad, in combination with banana and starfuit, and with bread. OBJECTIVE

3.  Results: How I ate the lemons. What the lemons tasted like in combination with different foods. SUBJECTIVE

4.  Discussion: What I think about eating lemons. SUBJECTIVE

### An author's mindmap

	% This ![復興空航](fushing.pdf "Flying 復興")

### Example self-introduction

Here is the IMRD report of the "adventure"  one of the authors wrote up using his mindmap.


	Introduction

	I flew to Japan during the vacation. The cheapest direct flight was 
	a 復興空航 one. I knew about the 2 crashes, the last only 8 months 
	before, so I had to decide whether to take the flight. Later, one 
	person told me, the crashes were on domestic flights, but the flight 
	I was going to take was an international flight, so perhaps safer.
	Another person said, When flying, you have no control. You might be 
	hit by a missile. What you do have control over is the airline you 
	choose, suggesting I should not choose 復興.

	Method

	I booked and paid for the 復興 flight. I did not tell my wife. She 
	will not fly on any 台灣 airline. I decided to write up the 
	"adventure" for my students as an example of Action Research, if I 
	lived through it.

	Results

	I got through the flight to Japan safely, but the plane was almost 
	empty. I sat by the window and there were only two, three people in 
	all eight seats over to the other window.

	On the flight back, however, the plane was packed full. Perhaps 
	they were all Japanese and didn't know about 復興's reputation. 
	I had had problems at the check-in counter in Japan, as I didn't 
	have a visa (簽證). They didn't know that Australians are 
	visa-exempt entering Taiwan. They said they might not be able to 
	let me fly. This didn't put me in a good mood. Looking at all 
	the passengers, I thought they looked like cattle, waiting to be 
	slaughtered. The plane made a diversion from the shortest course 
	as it approached 台灣 and then started flying around in circles. 
	The captain, who had seemed competent, speaking good English (I 
	couldn't place his accent), made no announcement about this 
	irregularity. I realized the plane had probably flown around 
	turbulence and was now in a holding pattern, waiting for its 
	turn to land. But I wondered if the plane was in trouble and we 
	were going to crash. Then we landed. I didn't die and wasn't 
	injured.

	Conclusion

	I will fly 復興 again if, and only if, it is the cheapest flight to 
	Japan at the Lunar New Year. Don't join me. I liked the empty 
	cabin. But probably the plane will be full again, seeing it's the 
	holiday season.

## Additional essays

### An essay about something risky (with an uncertain outcome) that you did

For homework, you wrote about something you did:

1. A plan: what you hoped/feared would happen,
2. What did happen,
3. What you thought about the experience

Rewrite this essay in IMRD format.

1. Introduction: Why did you choose this activity? What did you expect to happen?
2. Method: What actions did you take in real life?
3. Results: What was the response of the situation to your actions? What was the result of what you did? The results determine if the outcome was as you expected/hoped.
4. Discussion: How do you feel about what happened. What did you learn? And what will you do next time?

Do a mind map first with IMRD in the middle.

Write section titles,

- Introduction,
- Method,
- Results,
- Discussion,

each on a new line. Write approximately equal amounts in each section.
