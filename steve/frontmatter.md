# Preface

Writing distinguishes the educated person from the uneducated person. When native speakers are forming an impression of your capability, your intelligence, your usefulness, what they see in your writing is much more important than what they hear you say.

When you put words on paper, you are creating a thing, just as much as you are when building a house, or cooking food. It doesn't have a shape or form, like a house, or food. But it is real. You are turning thoughts or ideas into something which is real. Computer apps are real. They turn logic and mathematics into things that give people power and have effects on them. And your writing is real, too. It can change other people's lives.
