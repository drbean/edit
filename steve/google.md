## Translation from Chinese into English with Google, or Yahoo

Although you can use Google and Yahoo to translate Chinese words and sentences to see what they look like in English, you must not present any computer translation of a Chinese text as your composition.

The course is about English writing, not Chinese writing. It may be a good idea to have a plan for your compostion which you write in Chinese, rather than English. But if you want to use this plan in your composition you must translate it yourself, and you must construct the English sentences yourself, not with Google Translate or any other translation service.

So, don't write your composition in Chinese and submit the translation from Google. It's completely OK to use Google and Yahoo to find English equivalents for Chinese *words* and put them in your composition. But it's not OK to translate complete *sentences* and put *them* in.

Teachers can tell if a text has been produced by Google Translate. It reads like the work of a madman, being generally incoherent, but with a high density of vocabulary appropriate to the theme of the essay, as if the writer is a mad professor. ESL students write coherently and use a lot fewer words. Even though they make grammar mistakes, the mistakes are characteristic of ESL learners and teachers get to know them. The mistakes computer translations make are different, often resulting from the software having no understanding of the meaning of what they are translating.

It may have been easier to fool teachers before. One of the authors remembers being confused 12 years ago by a strange essay about the East coast of 台灣. Despite being a local story, it talked about ``Soviet-Australian'' using it as a noun, even though Soviet-Australian is an adjective. He had had no experience of students submitting translated essays and tried to make sense of it, assuming the student had submitted it in good faith.

Only after the course was finished did he realize that the student had translated a Chinese text using a translation service and had not even read it or bothered to change ``Soviet-Australian'' back to 蘇澳. And he was unable to give the student a zero grade for the essay and thump him on the head.

Don't be the one who the teacher vents his/her anger on for being lazy and letting Google do all the work.

Nowadays Google doesn't translate "蘇澳" as "Soviet-Australian", but teachers are on the look-out for computer translations. They can tell.
