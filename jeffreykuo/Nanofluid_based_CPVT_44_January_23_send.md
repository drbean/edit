In this study, the design and one-dimensional numerical analysis of a concentrated
photovoltaic thermal system incorporating a spectral-splitting nanofluid
was carried out. The nanofluid\'s spectral
transmittance with different loading concentrations of ZnO nanoparticles
over the full spectrum was measured experimentally, and a
model system using the nanofluid as a splitter developed. The design posited solar irradiation being
appropriately concentrated by a linear 1300-mm-by-70-mm Fresnel lens on a
series of seven 20-mm-outer-diameter and 16mm-inner-diameter 
tubes through which the nanofluid flowed, allowing a large beam of limited spectra to be transmitted
to the PV below, with the rest absorbed and converted to thermal energy. The
photo energy conversion dependency on the specific sample solution\'s
thermophysical properties, and on environmental parameters and
properties of the solar cell was investigated. A nanofluid with a 50
ppm concentration ratio achieved transmission of spectra closest to those most useful by the
photovoltaic band-gap. The temperature profile, power output, and
performance of the hybrid concentrated photovoltaic thermal system for
different loading concentrations of ZnO nanoparticles were computed.
Since the photovoltaic module was detached from the filtering channel and
integrated with the heat exchange pipe, its surface temperature was 
much lower than the nanofluid and output water temperature. The combined
efficiency of the system under the solar irradiance on a typical day
reached a maximum value of 50.35%, 65.2%, 72.70%, 74.7%, and 85% for ZnO
nanofluids with concentration ratios of 20 ppm, 50 ppm, 95 ppm, 200 ppm, and
500 ppm, respectively.

1.  **Introduction**

Solar energy is a welcome renewable energy source that can reduce 
fossil fuel dependency and meet energy needs. It can be collected and 
utilized by means of many processes, like  photosynthesis, solar 
thermal conversion and the photovoltaic effect. The technologies 
identified to convert solar energy into a useful form of energy are 
solar cells, solar thermal collectors, concentrated solar power and 
concentrated photovoltaic/thermal systems [1-3](#_ENREF_1)\[\].
Photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) collectors are a promising solar technology 
which is capable of cogenerating useful thermal energy and electricity 
from the same aperture area. These systems have played a pivotal role 
in the transition towards energy sustainability, providing more energy 
than the conventional photovoltaic cell [4](#_ENREF_4)[5](#_ENREF_5)\[, \].
Concentrating a large 
area of sunlight to focus a small beam on a solar energy process, using 
optical concentrators, allows for more incident irradiation and, 
therefore, more output power per unit area. The concentration of 
sunlight on photovoltaic cells (PV) and the consequent replacement of 
expensive PV panel arrays with cheap concentrating mirrors or lenses 
can reduce the cost of solar electricity [6](#_ENREF_6)[7](#_ENREF_7)\[, \].

Spectral energy at or near the band-gap of the semiconductor is utilized by
PV cells for photoelectrical energy conversion, but the remaining photon
energy is converted to thermal energy. This results in PV cell
heating, which reduces their power production efficiency 
[8](#_ENREF_8)[9](#_ENREF_9)\[, \]. An increase in solar
radiation flux in CPV/T systems also leads to the increase of CPV/T
system temperature which may lead to a high and precarious junction
temperature unless the heat is used for an intended purpose or
dissipated to the environment in time. When the PV cells\' operating
temperature is increased, not only is photo energy conversion efficiency 
decreased, but the PV cell material may also be damaged[10](#_ENREF_10)\[\].
One mechanism to solve this problem is spectral splitting:
the photon energy usable by PV cells is utilized by the PV cells, and
the remaining photons are engaged in thermal power generation [11-15](#_ENREF_11)\[\].
Nanofluid-based spectral splitting using low volume fractions of
nanoparticles has become increasingly more popular for CPV/T applications due
to the shift in the optical properties, inexpensively obtained. The loading of
nanoparticles as optical filters for CPV/T systems will decrease 
transmittance, leading to a decrease in the short circuit current and
lower electrical conversion efficiencies. Still, these powerfully
absorbing nanofluids produce higher photothermal conversion
efficiencies. The overall efficiency of the CPV/T system is dependent on
the volume fraction of nanoparticles chosen [16-18](#_ENREF_16)\[\]. 

Nanofluids, thus, are typically employed for energy conversion efficiency
enhancement since they exhibit high heat-transfer capabilities and
optical properties [19](#_ENREF_19)\[\]. But, it is important to find one
best kind of low cost nanofluid that can be applied to nanofluid-based
spectral splitting CPV/T systems [8](#_ENREF_8)\[\].

As stated above, several methods are proposed in the literature to
improve CPV/T system performance; employing a PV cooling system, using
appropriate concentrators, and applying spectral filters are popular.
Nanofluids offer a solution embodying all these characteristics.

We selected ZnO nanoparticles to prepare a nanofluid for a spectral splitting
CPV/T system due to its high thermal conductivity and low cost
[20](#_ENREF_20)\[\]. In the study, we designed and investigated the
integration of concentrated solar irradiation, to achieve higher
incident light on the system, with PV cooling and with spectral splitting, to
use the full spectrum in an optimum way. The general
objective of the study was to design an efficient concentrated hybrid
photovoltaic thermal energy system. We also developed a model and investigated
the energy conversion performance for the specific physical properties of the
system. The study will help satisfy the green energy needs of households,
industry and enterprises as an alternative solar electrical and
thermal conversion technology. It also contributes to promoting proper
green energy harvesting design with multi-purpose use of space and to developing
technology with practical applications.

2.   **Methodology**

We propose a CPV/T which converts full-spectrum incident sunlight to
both electricity and thermal energy. It constitutes an immediate solution to
using the entire solar spectrum for electricity in the PV band and for thermal
energy from the heat waste and radiation outside the PV band, for 
purposes of higher
temperature water heating. The concentrating system contains a Fresnel
lens, PV cell, nanofluid flowing in glass tubes, and heat exchangers
attached to the PV cell and in the form of a coil immersed in a water tank as shown
in Fig.1. Incident sunlight is firstly concentrated by the Fresnel lens.
The concentrated sunlight focuses on the nanofluid flowing in quartz
tubes. The photons which can be converted most efficiently by the PV are
transmitted to the PV module. The low-energy photons, which cannot be
converted by the PV, and high-energy photons, which would be converted
inefficiently, are absorbed and converted to thermal energy. The
electrical energy converted by the PV is recorded directly. The
heat pipe attached to the PV module is used as waste thermal energy
collector. This energy is extracted by fluid flowing in the pipe which
is directed to the heat exchange water tank. The outlet water
temperature from the pipe attached to the PV module is the inlet
water temperature for the water tank. Finally,
the tank\'s outlet water temperature is determined to calculate the
actual thermal energy derived from the full spectrum collected by the
CPV/T system. When the system is operating, water first flows through
the heat exchanger attached to the PV module, and then flows to the heat
exchange water tank to be further heated to a higher temperature.

A one-dimensional numerical model was developed for simulation purposes to
determine the temperature, electrical output, thermal power, and performance of
the whole system. The Fresnel lens\'s geometry, spectral splitting
nanofluid tubes, heat exchangers, and PV orientation were designed to
obtain the optimal system performance. The nanofluid\'s optical
properties were experimentally measured and used as input to the model to
determine the absorption and transmission of radiation in the spectral
splitting of the CPV/T system. The system was designed in such a way 
that the
visible light could be transmitted and light in the low and high wavelength
spectrum could be absorbed by the nanofluid. The zinc oxide nanofluid 
was
prepared using a two-step method with water and ethylene glycol (EG)
in a 50%:50% ratio. 1 mg, 2.5 mg, 4.75 mg, 10 mg and 25 mg of nano
powder ZnO were poured into a 50-ml water-glycol solution and
ultrasonically stirred for 30 minutes. In the following, the samples are represented
by the letters A, B, C, D, E and F where A is simply a solution of water and
EG, that is, A (0 ppm) and B (20 ppm), C (50 ppm), D (95 ppm), E (200 ppm) and F (500 ppm).

3.  **Model description**

The proposed CPV/T system is composed of a linear Fresnel lens, a side
by side channel of seven quartz tubes through which the nanofluid flows, a silicon PV
module, a heat exchange pipe attached to the PV, and an aluminum plate
as shown in Figs. 1 and 2. A linear Fresnel lens made of
polymethyl-methacrylate with dimensions 760x1300x5 mm is used to
concentrate the light rays on the upper surface of the nanofluid flowing
through the tubes. Seven quartz tubes with an inner diameter of 16 mm and an outer
diameter of 20 mm and 760mm in length are used for spectral splitting
nanofluid flow. The nanofluid is used for both spectral filtering and as an
intermediate thermal energy exchange.

The incident concentrated light from the Fresnel lens strikes the
top surface area of the tubes. This implies that the effective
light exposure surface area of the filtering channel is about 0.167
m^2^, and the concentration ratio is 5.916. Four monocrystalline silicon
photovoltaic modules each 190x380x35 mm in size, with cell efficiency 21.5% and
10 w power at standard test conditions (1000 w/m^2^ solar radiation
intensity, 25 $℃\ $environmental temperature and air mass 1.5) are placed under the tubes. The
effective area of the PV module is 0.288 m^2^, and the geometric
concentration ratio is 3.43. The nanofluid absorbs spectral radiation,
preventing it from reaching the solar cell, before flowing into a heat exchange water tank and passing through
a copper coil. It releases thermal energy while flowing in the coil
immersed in the insulated water tank. The thermal power and thermal
efficiency of the system are determined by using the outlet and
inlet temperature of water from the water tank heat exchanger. The
nanofluid is finally collected in a nanofluid tank completing the
cycle, ready for spectral filtering next day.

The homogeneity of the photons impinging on the CPV module, dimensional
specification of the model elements, and the optimal distance between
the filtering and PV module was studied using Tracepro. The lumped thermal
capacitance method was applied for the energy equations in each layer of
the subsystem to determine the power collected and the overall
performance of the whole system.

4.  **Mathematical modeling**

A model was formulated to evaluate the spectral splitting CPV/T system.
The model analysis was performed by applying energy balance equations
for the concentrator, spectral filtering, PV module layers, and heat
exchangers. With these, it was possible to predict the temperature, the
electrical and thermal powers, and the electrical and thermal
efficiencies of the CPV/T. The amount of solar radiation reaching
the PV module\'s surface is a function of the geometric concentration
ratio *CR,* the intensity *I* of the direct normal irradiation and
optical efficiency of the Fresnel lens, the transmittance of the
nanofluid flow and the surface area * *of the PV module. 

###  Assumptions to simplify the CPV/T model system in this study are:

1)  One dimensional uniform temperature distribution of the system is
    assumed due to the small area of the protective aluminum frame attached
    to the Fresnel lens, the filtering tube channel and the PV module
    [21](#_ENREF_21)[22](#_ENREF_22)\[, \].

2)  The nanofluid and water inlet temperature to the exchange attached
    to the PV module was taken equal to the ambient temperature.

3)  Reflection of sunlight is ignored since we used a Fresnel lens,
    quartz tube, and glass with high transmittance [23](#_ENREF_23)\[\].

4)  The thermophysical properties of the model elements are independent
    of temperature [24](#_ENREF_24)\[\].

5)  The nanofluid flow is turbulent, uniform, and incompressible
    [25](#_ENREF_25)\[\].

6)  Heat loss is ignored due to the insulation material
    [22](#_ENREF_22)\[\].

The power coming to the system through the Fresnel lens is
[26](#_ENREF_26)[27](#_ENREF_27)\[, \].

$$Q_{\text{inc}} = A_{F}\int_{\lambda_{i}}^{\lambda_{f}}{I\left( \lambda \right)d\lambda\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (1\ )}$$

where *I* is the spectral solar radiation intensity with air mass 1.5,
$\lambda$ is the wavelength, and $A_{F}$ is the surface area of the Fresnel
lens. The total amount of power incident to
the [nano](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/beam-splitter)fluid
splitter can be calculated by Eq. (2)
[27](#_ENREF_27)[28](#_ENREF_28)\[, \].

$$Q_{\text{in}} = {\text{CR}_{\text{Tc}}\text{\ A}}_{\text{TC}}\int_{\lambda_{i}}^{\lambda_{f}}{I(\lambda)\tau_{F}\left( \lambda \right)}d\lambda\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (2)$$

where $\text{CR}_{\text{Tc}}$ and $A_{\text{TC}}$ are the concentration
ratio and the effective surface area of the nanofluid splitter tubes, and
$\tau_{F}\text{\ \ }$the transmittance of the Fresnel concentrator. More
than 99% of the surface solar flux is contained in the spectral region
between 300 nm initial wavelength and 2500 nm final wavelength, hence
solar radiation energy apart from this band can be ignored
[27-29](#_ENREF_27)\[\]. Transparent quartz tubes are used to hold the
nanofluid to reduce optical loss. This solar energy is equal to the
thermal energy absorbed by the nanofluid, the transmitted energy to the
PV module and the energy loss.

The power absorbed by the nanofluid is
[27](#_ENREF_27)[29](#_ENREF_29)\[, \].

$$Q_{\text{ab}} = \text{CR}_{\text{TC}}A_{\text{TC}}\int_{300}^{2500}{I\left( \lambda \right)\eta_{\text{opc}}}\tau_{\text{Tc}}(\lambda)\alpha_{\text{nf}}\left( \lambda \right)d\lambda\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (3)$$

where $\eta_{\text{opc}}\ $is the optical efficiency of the
concentrator, $\tau_{\text{Tc}}\left( \lambda \right)\ $is the
transmittance of the tube, and $\alpha_{\text{nf}}$ is the absorbance of
the nanofluid at wave length, λ. Solar radiation
absorbed by the nanofluid is equal to the thermal energy transferred to
the water while the nanofluid is flowing inside the coil and the energy
lost. The insulation layer exchanges the heat by conduction with the
heat exchanger and by convection with the ambient air.

The power transmitted from the nanofluid filtering tube channel to the
PV module integrated with the heat pipe sub system is [27-29](#_ENREF_27)\[\]:

$$Q_{\text{pv}} = \text{CR}_{\text{pv}}A_{\text{pv}}\int_{300}^{2500}{I(\lambda)\eta_{\text{opc}}\tau_{\text{Tc}}^{2}}(\lambda)\tau_{\text{nf}}(\lambda)d\lambda\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (4)$$

where $\text{CR}_{\text{pv}}$ and $A_{\text{pv}}$ are the geometrical
concentration ratio and area of the PV surface, respectively, and$\ \tau_{\text{nf}}$
is the transmittance of the nanofluid. Total solar
energy transmitted to the PV module is equal to the sum of the produced
electric power, the heat dissipated to the ambient air through convection
and radiation and the thermal energy conducted to the heat exchanger
attached to the PV, the three forms of energy into which it is transferred. The outflowing water from the heat exchange attached
to the PV module is connected to the heat exchange water tank for
further heating. According to the radiation transfer model, the spectral
reflectivity, absorptivity and transmittance of the nanofluid filter
depend on the wavelength of the incident light and the incidence angle.
Therefore the power in each layer is affected by the optical property of
the material selected and its geometry.

As is shown in Fig. 3, the present system is composed of the linear
Fresnel lens, spectral splitter, PV module, heat pipe water channel
on the back of the PV cells, and water tank heat exchange. When the sunlight
converged by the Fresnel lens passes through the quartz tubes filled with
nanofluid, a portion of the solar energy is absorbed and converted into
heat by the nanofluid, while the rest is transmitted to the PV
module. The nanofluid in the tube is not only the spectral splitting
filter, but also the medium for absorbing and transporting heat from the
energy receiver.

The electrical power converted can be calculated by
[27](#_ENREF_27)[30](#_ENREF_30)\[, \]:

$$P_{\text{ele}} = J_{\text{sc}}V_{\text{oc}}\text{FF\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ }\left( 5 \right)$$

where $V_{\text{oc}},$ FF and, $J_{\text{sc}}$ are the open circuit voltage,
fill factor and short-circuit current of the PV given by
[31](#_ENREF_31)\[\]:

$J_{\text{sc}} = \text{CR}_{\text{pv}}A_{\text{pv}}\int_{300}^{2500}{I\left( \lambda \right)\eta_{\text{op}}}\tau_{\text{Tc}}^{2}(\lambda)S(\lambda)\tau_{\text{nf}}\left( \lambda \right)d\lambda\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (6$)

where $S(\lambda)$ is the optical response of the silicon solar cell
[32](#_ENREF_32)\[\]. The open-circuit voltage can be calculated by 
equation Eq. (7).

$$V_{\text{oc}} = \frac{A^{'}k_{B}T_{\text{pv}}}{e}\ln\left( \frac{{\text{CR}_{\text{pv}}\text{\ J}}_{\text{sc}}}{J_{o}} + 1 \right)\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (7)$$

where A′ and $T_{\text{pv}}\ $are the ideality factor and surface
temperature of the solar cell, respectively, $k_{B}$ the Boltzmann constant, e the
elementary charge, and $J_{o}$ the dark saturation current density,
which is given by [33](#_ENREF_33)[34](#_ENREF_34)\[, \]:

$$J_{o} = K^{'}T_{\text{pv}}^{\frac{3}{n}}\exp^{\frac{{- E}_{g}}{bk_{B}T_{\text{pv}}}}\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (8)$$

where $K^{'}$ is an empirical parameter. The filling factor is
calculated using:

$$FF = \frac{V_{m}}{V_{\text{oc}}}\left( 1 - \frac{\exp\left( \frac{eV_{m}}{k_{B}T_{\text{pv}}} \right) - 1}{\exp\left( \frac{eV_{\text{oc}}}{k_{B}T_{\text{pv}}} \right) - 1} \right)\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (9)$$

where $V_{m}$ is the voltage at the maximum power point of the I - V curve given
by:

$V_{m} = k \times V_{\text{oc\ }}\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (10)$

where k is an empirical parameter of the solar cell.

The electrical efficiency of the CPV/T system is calculated by

$$\eta_{\text{el}} = \frac{J_{\text{sc}}V_{\text{oc}}\text{FF}}{Q_{\text{inc}}}\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (11)$$

The short current of the PV module is used to calculate its
corresponding open circuit voltage and fill factor based on the reported
PV model [34](#_ENREF_34)\[\]. Finally, the electrical power output can
be obtained through multiplying the current by the open circuit voltage and
fill factor.

The thermal power output from the system collected by the exchange
integrated with the PV module, nanofluid, and water tank can be
determined by;

$$Q_{\text{th}} = {\dot{m}}_{w}c_{p,w}\left( T_{w,out} - T_{\text{inl}} \right)\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (12)$$

where ${\dot{m}}_{w}\ $and$\ c_{p,w}$ are the mass flow rate and the
specific heat capacity of water and $T_{w,out}$ and $T_{\text{inl}}$ are
the outlet and inlet water temperature, respectively.

The thermal efficiency of the system is given by:

$$\text{\ η}_{\text{th}} = \frac{Q_{\text{th}}}{Q_{\text{inc}}}\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (13)$$

The overall efficiency of the system will be calculated by Eq. (14)
[35](#_ENREF_35)\[\].

$$\eta_{\text{tot}} = \eta_{\text{el}} + \eta_{\text{th}}\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (14)$$

The merit function of the CPV/T system is calculated by Eq. (15)
using as a standard a 3:1 worth factor ($w_{f}$) of electricity to thermal
energy to determine if the selected liquid would effectively convert
sunlight into usable energy, as compared to the electrical power output
of an unfiltered solar cell.

$$MF = \ \frac{{w_{f}\text{\ P}}_{\text{el}}\left( \text{filtered} \right) + P_{\text{th}}}{w_{f}P_{\text{el}}(unfiltered)}\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (15)$$

### Applying the electrical equivalent circuit of the heat transfer in each layer of the CPV/T system and the setup of the differential equations is summarized as follows. The thermal resistance network circuit of the CPV/T model system is presented in Fig. 3.

The thermal capacitance is defined by Eq. (16) [36](#_ENREF_36)\[\]

$$C = \rho A\delta c\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (16)$$

where $\rho$ is the density, A the area, $\text{δ\ }$ the thickness,
and c the specific heat capacity of the circuit element in the model.

$$R_{cov,co,w} = \frac{1}{h_{w}\text{πD}_{\text{co}}L}\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (51)$$

where $\text{Nu}_{w}\ $is the Nusselt number, $k_{w}$ is the thermal
conductivity of water, and $D_{i}$ is the hydraulic diameter, which is the inner

module was set to 0.00166 kg/s and the inlet temperature of the
water was taken to be equal to the ambient temperature. The temperature of the
water in the tube is the average of the inlet and outlet temperature of
water in the tube.

6.  **Results and discussion**

    1.  Energy allocation

The specification transmittance of ZnO nanofluid with five different
concentrations was measured using a
V-670 spectrophotometer for different wavelengths ranging from 300--2500 nm at
intervals of 5 nm. The sample solutions and the spectral transmittance measurements
are presented in Fig. 5 below. The nanofluid highly absorbed the short-
and long-wavelength radiation. Photons at these wavelength ranges are
outside the usable PV electrical energy conversion band. The high
concentration of nanofluid spectral filtering results in high absorbance,
and the low concentration results in high transmittance of the spectra.
Therefore, at some point between these two extremes, there lies an optimum concentration of nanofluid for the
intended requirement that maximal thermal and electrical energy be generated. The results obtained
show that the 50 ppm nanofluid solution transmits the spectra that best allow photons to excite electrons
across the silicon solar cell band gap. So this concentration is preferable to generate optimum
amounts of both electrical and thermal energy.

The photo energy conversion obtained with each sample solution depends on the thermophysical properties of
the specific solution and its ZnO concentration, and on environmental parameters
and the properties of the solar cell. To investigate this conversion, we determined important
parameters specific to our samples from their base materials. The major
findings using the parameters of the experiment and the model are summarized in
Table 2 and Fig. 6. Then we applied the model we developed to analyze
power output and system performance.

Fig. 6 shows the thermal conductivity of the nanofluid solution
calculated using equation 35. It demonstrates that the
thermal conductivity of the fluid improves as more ZnO nanoparticles
are loaded into the solution. The increase in thermal conductivity of
the nanofluid enhances the heat transfer rate in the heat exchange water
tank. In this study, the heat transfer rate was highest for a 500-ppm
particle-loaded sample.

The input local direct solar irradiation on August 19, 2020 (Taiwan,
Taipei) is presented in Fig. 7. The solar radiation intensity increased
to a maximum value of 842.96 w/m^2^ at noon and then dropped to 9.98
w/m^2^. The model analysis was carried out using these solar radiation
intensity figures with the specified solar concentration on the filtering channel
and the PV surface. Ray tracing and distribution on the tubes\' upper

Applying Eqs. (1) and (2), the power collected by the concentrator and
the amount of irradiative power reaching the top surface of the spectral
filtering tube channel were determined using MATLAB. The solar spectral
irradiance on the Fresnel lens and spectral response of the PV are presented
in Fig. 8. Using the optical data for the nanoparticles\' different
loading concentrations, we numerically found the power absorbed by the
nanofluid, power transmitted to the PV module integrated with the heat
exchanger, and the short circuit current density. The least energy
absorbed was observed with the base fluid and the most with the 500-ppm
sample. As shown in Fig. 9 b, the power absorbed by the
nanofluid increased as the concentration increased. The power
absorbed by the base fluid and nanofluid with the highest concentration
ratio was 163.97 w/m^2^ and 676.13 w/m^2^, respectively. This means
that the spectral solar insolation on the surface of the PV module
decreased. That value was 575.97 w/m^2^ for the base fluid and 89.63 w/m^2^
for the most concentrated nanofluid. This allocated power was used as
input to the mathematical model to find the temperature profiles, power
output, and performance of the CPV/T system.

2.  Temperature profile

The hourly varying temperature of each subsystem in the model was
computed for the different nanofluid concentrations and is presented in Fig.
10. As in previously published research, our study indicates that the
nanofluid\'s working temperature increases proportionally to the
increase in the concentration of nanoparticles. Since the PV module is detached from the
filtering channel and integrated with the heat exchange pipe, its
surface temperature is much lower than the nanofluid temperature, even in the case of low-concentration samples. Each
subsystem\'s surface or bulk temperature in the model affects the
following layers\' temperatures due to radiation, conduction, or
convective heat transfer. In the case of the base fluid or a nanofluid with a low
concentration ratio, our results show a smaller rise in the
nanofluid's temperature is accompanied by higher heat exchange-coupled PV module
temperatures. This is due to the lesser absorption of energy by the filtering channel, leaving large amounts of energy free to 
strike the PV surface. But the heat pipe properly absorbs the waste
heat energy. So, it is also found that the hourly varying surface
temperature of the PV module is consistently less than that of the nanofluid flowing through the
filter channel and heat exchange water tank for the base fluid and
other nanoparticle loading concentration ratios. The output 
temperature of the water heated by the pipe attached to the PV and the heat exchange
water tank increased as the concentration increased. The maximum
output water temperature computed was at 14:00, and its value was 313.74
K, 315.90 K, 324.13 K, 332.56 K, 333.42 K, and 350.68 K for samples A,
B, C, D, E, and F, respectively.

3.  Power output

We numerically determined the system\'s electrical and thermal power
output based on the proposed optical, electrical, and thermal models.
The hourly varying electrical power output and short current density of
the model are presented in figure 11. The highest power output and short
circuit current was obtained for the base fluid, and the smallest value
was for the 500 ppm sample solution. The result clearly shows that the
increase in loading concentration of nanoparticles decreases the
electrical power output and short circuit current. The peak value of electric
power for the samples A, B, C, D, E, and F are 183.81 w/m^2^, 167.14
w/m^2^, 129.57 w/m^2^, 108.34 w/m^2^, 106.67 w/m^2^ , 29.47 w/m^2^,
respectively.

The hourly varying thermal power output of the model is presented in
Fig. 12. As discussed above, the nanofluid in the filter channel
absorbs energy from parts of the spectrum and then outflows into the coil immersed
in a heat exchange water tank, which is the source of thermal power. The
greater the nanoparticles\' concentration, the more the absorption of energy from the
spectrum, which directly contributes to the increases in thermal power
output.

4.  Energy conversion performance

The energy conversion efficiency of our model system is presented in
Fig.13. The results show extensive time variation in thermal efficiency and
the almost stable electrical energy efficiency of the system. The electrical
efficiency of the CPV/T module without nanoparticles was 19.5%. This
photoelectrical conversion efficiency of the CPV/T module decreased
to 18.75%, 14.53%, 12.15% 11.96%, and 3.30% for the 20 ppm, 50 ppm, 95
ppm, 200 ppm and 500 ppm concentration ratio sample solutions, respectively. The
decrease in electrical efficiency is mainly caused by solar insolation
reductions on the CPV module\'s surface. The photons absorbed by the
concentrated solutions contribute to an enhancement of thermal efficiency that
compensates for the photoelectrical efficiency reduction. The maximum
overall efficiency of the system computed was 46.83%, 50.35% , 65.21 %,
72.27 %, 74.69%, and 85.27% for samples A, B, C, D, E, and F,
respectively.

The usefulness of the model\'s energy conversion was analyzed with the merit
function and was found to increase in value from 1.076 to 1.184, over the
samples A to F, respectively. This shows that the nanofluid filter
effectively converts the absorbed light to useful energy.

We designed a linear Fresnel lens-based CPV/T system collecting an extremely wide
light beam into an effective nanofluid filtering and PV module system
integrated with a heat exchange pipe. The 
filtering tubes arranged in rows without a gap allow intense light striking the top
surface to be transmitted or absorbed, contributing intended amounts of power to 
the required form of either photoelectrical or thermal energy conversion. In the study, we
investigated the photon energy conversion\'s dependence on the specific
sample solution\'s thermophysical properties and on environmental
parameters and the properties of the solar cell. The prepared nanofluid\'s
optical properties were measured by UV-VIS spectrometer, and light ray
distribution and local solar irradiation information were
obtained with Tracepro. These parameters were applied to the developed model
to analyze the model\'s power output, system performance
and energy benefits. The major findings are summarized below.

-   A light beam focused by a Fresnel lens on sequentially-arranged filtering tubes of
    the optimum diameter without a gap, together 
    with a PV module to which a heat exchanger is attached, can be employed as
    a resourceful photo energy conversion system. It is one novelty of our
    study that the light rays travel equal distances while propagating inside
    the tubes and distribute uniformly. Many other researchers, as
    far as it is our understanding, have used other forms of 
    channel.

-   Using optical data for the different loading
    concentrations of nanoparticles, we numerically found the power absorbed by the
    nanofluid and the power transmitted to the PV module integrated with the
    heat exchange. The use of a 50:50% water-ethylene glycol solution as a
    base fluid will filter out 19.58% of the total solar irradiation on
    the CPV/T system. It was also found that the nanofluid solution with
    concentration ratios of 20 ppm, 50 ppm, 95 ppm, 200 ppm, and 500 ppm will
    filter 22.94%, 42.43%, 50.59%, 52.08%, and 80.75% of the spectrum,
    respectively.

-   We numerically determined the temperature profiles of the elements of the
    model system and found that the filtering tubes and nanofluid
    have the highest values. The peak temperature of
    the nanofluid is higher, by far, than the PV module's peak temperature
    for all samples A to F, and the temperature of the water in the tank
    rises to a peak value at 14:00 of 313.73 K, 314.19 K , 324.12 K
    332.56 K, 333.42 K, and 350.68 K, respectively.

-   The combined efficiency of the system under the solar irradiance of
    a typical day with a geometrical concentration ratio of 5.8
    at the filtering channel and 3.43 at the PV module reaches a maximum value of
    50.35%, 65.2%, 72.70%, 74.7%, and 85% for a ZnO nanofluid of
    concentration ratios 20 ppm, 50 ppm, 95 ppm, 200 ppm, and 500 ppm,
    respectively.

-   The usefulness of the model\'s energy conversion was analyzed by
    merit function and was found to increase in value from 1.076 to
    1.184, over the samples A to F, respectively.
