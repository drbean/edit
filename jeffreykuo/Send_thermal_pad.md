**Hybrid Sol-Gel-Derived Method for the Synthesis of 
Silicon Rubber Composites with h-BN for Characteristic Applications in Elastomeric
Thermal Pads**

Abstract

Elastomeric thermal pads are materials that are used to support
heat sinks for effective and efficient heat dissipation. These
pads contain rubber and a thermally-conductive filler. Rubber is
responsible for their flexibility while the filler's role is to
efficiently dissipate heat. In this study, two different types of
silicone resin (MQ), Vi-MQT and Al-MQT, were synthesized by
the hydrolysis-polycondensation method and introduced in a silicone rubber/boron
nitride (*h*-BN) composite to enhance the thermal conductivity of the material while retaining
acceptable flexibility properties. Introduction of the MQ resin reduced 
crosslink density, thermal stability, tensile strength and hardness of
the silicone resin composite while it improved elongation. Replacing the MQ
resin with Vi-MQT and Al-MQT resins improved the silicone
rubber's properties. The addition of Vi-MQT resin reduced crosslink density, tensile
strength and hardness and improved its elongation and thermal stability properties.
While Al-MQT resin did not have significant effect on crosslink
density, tensile strength or hardness, it also improved 
elongation and reduced thermal stability. High filler concentration
of *h*-BN in the composite enhanced thermal conductivity up to 3.253 W
m^-1^ K^-1^, while it reduced tensile strength to 1.248 MPa and elongation
to 22% but increased hardness up to 75 shore A. Addition of silicone resin
improved the thermal conductivity of all MQ, Vi-MQT3 and
Al-MQT3 resin composites up to 3.661, 3.962 and 4.817 W m^-1^ K^-1^, respectively.
For the same three resins, tensile strength was increased up to 1.274, 1.290 and 1.312 Mpa, elongation at break
raised to 125, 188 and 150% and hardness reduced to 69, 71 and 72 shore A.
respectively. The addition of silicone resin also showed an
effect on density, volatile content, flame resistance and volume
resistivity.

**Introduction**

Thermal management is a crucial aspect of microelectronic design,
as it is a challenge to efficiently dissipate heat from heat source to
the ambient. Generally, the heat generated by the device is transferred to a
heat sink by heat conduction.^1-3^ However, the utilization of heat sinks for
heat transfer is made problematic by the existence of small surface irregularities between
the device and heat sink surfaces. Elastomeric thermal pads,
made of a thermally conductive rubber consisting of rubber/polymeric elastomer
material mixed with thermally conductive inorganic filler, are one way adopted to approach this problem. 
A popular matrix used for such thermal pads is silicone rubber,
an elastomer (rubber-like material) composed of siloxane (a functional group consisting of
alternate silicon and oxygen atoms, -Si-O- on a backbone chain with 
substituents branching from the silicon atom.)^4,5^ The thermal conductivity of
silicone rubber alone, being about 0.2 W m^-1^ K^-1^, ^6-9^, cannot satisfy the
requirement of a thermal conductive application. However, addition of an inorganic
filler can provide a thermally conductive path, which is a very important
requirement for effective heat transfer. Ceramic fillers, like oxides and
nitrides, are widely used as inorganic filler for elastomer thermal
pads. Nitride-based fillers, such as aluminum nitride (AlN) and boron
nitride (BN), have attracted much attention for their use in thermal pads due to
their higher thermal conductivity and electrical resistivity compared
with other ceramic-based fillers, making them a suitable filler for thermal
dissipation materials.^10-12^

Research has been conducted to investigate the performance of
silicone rubber/boron nitride composites. Kemaloglu et al. ^13^ studied
the properties of thermally conductive micro-
and nanosize BN reinforced silicone rubber composites. The addition of
BN to the silicone rubber decreased the tensile strength and the strain
at break of the composites regardless of BN type due to poor
interfacial interaction, while the nanosize filler showed better
performance than the microsize. The hardness of the composites with the nanosize
filler also increased more than with the microsize. The thermal conductivity of
the microsize composite was higher than the nanosize, probably due
to the lower aspect ratio of the nanosize filler. Ha et al.^14^ also worked to
enhance the thermal conductivity of PDMS, incorporating BN as
a thermally conductive filler. The thermal conductivity of the PDMS composite
increased from 0.2219 W m^-1^ K^-1^ to 1.5971 W m^-1^ K^-1^ with the
addition of 100 phr of BN filler, for an approximately 700% thermal
conductivity enhancement. The tensile strength of
the composite also increased from 0.418 MPa to 2.827 MPa with the addition of
100 phr of filler. Elongation increased 19% to 37.3% 
on addition of 50 phr, but for the addition of 100 phr, it only increased to 30.0%, 7.3% less than the figure for the 
addition of 50 phr. Shi et al.^15^ improved the elongation of
poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) with the addition of MQ resin without sacrificing
its tensile strength. MQ resins dissolve well in PDMS, making their use
possible as a universal modifier for silicone elastomers. Robinson et
al.^16^ investigated the influence of BN on the network structure and
properties of PDMS composite materials. The tensile modulus of the composites
increased from 0.16 MPa to 8.53 MPa on a 0.5 BN filler weight fraction
and thermal conductivity increased up to 0.84 W m^-1^ K^-1^. Chen et
al.^17^ investigated the influence of MQ resins on the performance of
PDMS composites with nano-silica sol. They obtained an extradinary
enhancement of elongation at break of around 10 times and other tensile
properties also increased with the addition of MQ resin. Gu et al.^18^
successfully synthesized the polymethyl-vinyl siloxane rubber (VMQ)
composite with *h*-BN to obtain high thermally conductive rubber. They
presented a strong argument for their use, showing that the addition of *h*-BN filler to such composites increased
their thermal conductivity from 0.179 W m^-1^
K^-1^ for neat VMQ rubber to 1.110 W m^-1^ K^-1^ on addition of 40%
weight filler, a figure which is 6 times larger than that for neat VMQ rubber. Tensile
strength also increased from 0.28 MPa to 3.31 MPa with the addition of 20% 
filler by weight but then decreased from 3.31MPa to 1.75 Mpa for the
addition of 40%. This phenomenon was due to the incomplete dispersion of *h*-BN
filler and more defects being formed. Fang et al.^19^ combined BN foam
(BNF) and BN nanosheets (BNNS) with PDMS and investigated their effect on
the thermal, mechanical and dielectric properties of the composites. They
obtained thermal conductivity increases for the BNNS/PDMS composite from 0.21 W m^-1^ K^-1^ for
neat PDMS to 0.36 W m^-1^ K^-1^ for a 10% addition by weight of BNNS
and for the BNNS/BNF/PDMS one to 0.56 W m^-1^ K^-1^ for the same percentage addition of BNNS/BNF, both
enhancements of thermal conductivity. The tensile
strength and Young's modulus of the BNNS/BNF/PDMS composite also increased from 1.41 MPa to 1.65 MPa and from 0.99 MPa to 1.32
MPa, respectively. The breakdown strength
of the BNNS composite rose from 16.8 MV m^-1^ to 21.8 MV m^-1^ for the same loading, indicating good insulation properties.

Liang et al.^20^ conducted a study of the hybridization of reduced graphene
oxide (RGO) with MQ silicone resin to enhance the thermal conductivity
and mechanical performance of the silicone rubber composite. They obtained
improvement of shore A hardness, tensile strength and elongation at
break of 254%, 528% and 327% with 20% by-weight additions of RGO/MQ filler, compared
with neat silicone rubber, respectively. Thermal conductivity for the RGO/MQ filler was 
significantly higher than for the RGO filler at 0.51 W m^-1^ K^-1^ for the former for a 25% addition by weight, as compared with the 0.27 W m^-1^ K^-1^ 
for the latter for the same concentration.
Kuo et al.^21^'s use of heatsinks combined with
elastomeric thermal pads is a general solution for heat dissipation. Silicone
rubber composites in such pads exhibit excellent thermal conductivity with the
incorporation of boron nitride (BN) as a filler. In the study, TEOS was doped onto
the surface of hydroxyl-functionalized BN using a simple sol--gel
process for surface modification. The thermal conductivity and surface
modification of the composites improved 16.52% on BN filler addition up
to 45 wt%. The addition of TEOS not only improved the filler dispersion
in the composite system but also reduced the interfacial mismatch
between the BN and silicone rubber. The tensile strength and hardness
increased on addition of the BN filler, but elongation at the break
decreased with high filler loadings. Kuo et al.^22^ synthesized similar
silicone thermal pads using the Taguchi method and concluded that the
optimum experimental combination was BNNSs with lamella thickness
(B~24~), a BNNS loading level of 20wt%, and an Al~2~O~3~ loading level
of 60 wt%. The thermal conductivity, tensile strength and Shore hardness
of the silicone thermal pads, which were prepared by thermosetting, were 5.25 W/mK, 7.55 kg/cm^2^ and 65.2
(Shore A), respectively. Their thermal conductivity and
tensile strength were 34.48% and 20.26% higher than those of commercially available
silicone thermal pads, respectively. A controlling
factor influencing the thermal conductivity and tensile strength of
the silicone thermal pads was the BNNS loading level, with contribution
degrees of 34.66% and 50.13%, respectively. Kuo et al.^23^ synthesized
a nano-size particle as a thermally conductive filler for a silicone
thermal pad (STP) by exfoliating hexagonal-boron nitride (h-BN) with the
chemical exfoliation-free radical polymerization method to produce boron
nitride nano-sheets (BNNSs). As the free radical polymerization reaction
time increased, the interlayer distance of BNNSs lengthened to 0.35 nm,
while the thickness of the h-BN sheets decreased.

Elastic thermal pads can provide good thermal conductivity without the
difficulty associated with thermal grease, as managing these materials
is easier than thermal grease. Elastomeric thermal pads are themselves a
logical extension of thermal grease: cured conductive paste in the form of a
pad, compressible to within 25% of their
total thickness to conform to irregular surfaces, and competing with
the flowability of their semi-fluid rival ^24^. Solving the main issue of the poor
flexibility of silicone rubber composites with an inorganic particle promises to make
the existence of silicone resin an attractive
solution to obtaining high thermally conductive rubber without sacrificing
flexibility. Silicone resin modified with some functional group to
enhance the reinforcing effect of the silicone rubber/*h*-BN composite would appear to be the way ahead.

Boron nitride (BN) consists of boron (B) and nitrogen (N) atoms,
covalently bonded in a honeycomb configuration, as a layered structure.
The most investigated structure is *c*-BN and *h*-BN. The *c*-BN has
sp^3^ atomic bonding, while the *h*-BN has characteristic sp^2^ atomic
bonding.^11,25,26^ *h*-BN is the most stable under standard conditions
and is an sp^2^-hybridized two dimension-layered insulator. *h*-BN has
various properties, such as excellent lubricant properties, anisotropy
parallel and perpendicular to a basal plane, constant wide band gap
ranging from 5.5 to 6.4 eV, superior anti-oxidative and structural
stabilities, chemical inertness, non toxicity and environmental safety,
high thermal conductivity (600 Wm^-1^K^-1^ for the in-plane direction,
30Wm^-1^K^-1^ for the out-of-plane direction) and a superior thermal expansion
coefficient, as well as superior mechanical properties.^10-12^ These
characteristics render *h*-BN as an excellent material for fillers in composites that are thermally
conductive but also electrically insulating. Despite these
exceptional properties and potential for widespread application, the practical
applications of *h*-BN are highly restricted by their high surface
energy and a strong tendency to agglomerate, causing problems with
dispersion and interfacial quality.^10^ These two factors are well known
as the most critical as far as the properties and functionalities of polymer
composites are concerned.

In recent years, sol-gel materials have been widely applied to improve
the mechanical properties and thermal stability of silicone rubber and other composites.^27^
As a sol-gel material, silicone resin is useful as a reinforcing constituent
in some applications because of its silica content and particle-like
physical structure. Silicone resins types often called MQ resins are
tridimensional highly branched silicon-based macromolecules consisting of
different functional siloxane units.^27-29^ Introducing various
functional groups in the chemical structure is used to provide some
specific functionality. MQ resins immediately dissolve in a hydrocarbon
solvent and in PDMS. This key feature makes it possible to use them
widely in compositions with PDMS as reinforcing additives and fillers,
and curing catalysts and crosslinking agents developing composite materials. It has 
been argued that MQ resins are an almost universally-applicable modifier for silicone
polymers that improve the properties of all formulations. ^27^

In this study, silicone resins were synthesized using the sol-gel process
and different forms of silicone rubber reinforced *h*-BN filler composite created
to investigate the influence of silicone resin additions on the physical,
mechanical, thermal stability, density, volatile content and flame
resistance properties of the silicone rubber/*h*-BN composites. Comparing
these properties, the performance of new silicone rubbers as elastic thermal pads
can be evaluated.

# **Materials and methods**

## Materials

We used the following chemicals to synthesize the silicone resins-hBN
composites; Tetraethoxysilane (TEOS, 98%, Acros Organic Co.Ltd.,
Germany), Trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS, 98%, Acros Organic Co.Ltd.,
Germany), Aluminum ethoxide (ATE, \>98% Tokyo Chemical Industry Co.,
Japan), Vinyltrimethoxylsilane (VTMS, OFS-6300, Ya-Hu-Chi Industrial
Co., Taiwan), and. TMCS as M unit, TEOS as Q unit, VTMS as T unit.
Two-system silicone rubber (KET-1001-10 A/B, Shin Etsu Co. Ltd.,
Taiwan), Toluene, industrial grade solvent (Trans Chief Chemical
Industry Co. Ltd., Taiwan.) Tetrahydrofuran (THF, 99% HPLC grade, Duksan
Pure Chemicals Co., South Korea.), Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO~3~, Chruch
& Dwight Co., USA.) was used as a neutralizing agent. Hexagonal boron
nitride (*h*-BN, U Materials Co.Ltd., Taiwan).

**Experimental Design**

This study was divided into two steps, i.a., preparation of silicone
resins and preparation of elastomeric thermal pads. The first step was
synthesized silicone resin with functional monomers. Then, silicone
resins along with silicone rubber and the *h*-BN particle were
compounded on two-roll mixing mill machine, and thermoformed to form a
thermal pad.

**Preparation of silicone resins**

The silicone resins were synthesized using the hydrolysis-polycondensation
method. TMCS was used as M unit, TEOS was used as a Q unit, and VTMS and
ATE were used as T unit. The \[M\]/\[Q+T\] molar ratio of 0.8 that was used was
based on a previous study. ^30,31^ The concentration of the T unit 
varied between 1, 3 and 5% of TEOS weight. The synthesis of MQ resin proceeded as
follows: a mixture of TMCS and toluene was added into a three-necked
flask and the temperature was held constant at 30^o^C. An appropriate
amount of deionized water was added to the mixture for 10 min and then
heated up to 70^o^C. An amount of TEOS, VTMS and/or ATE were dripped (90
min) into the flask and held for 2 hr. After cooling to room
temperature, the mixture was separated from the organic solution and
washed repeatedly with a NaHCO~3~ solution until pH reached 6. Then, the
mixture was dissolved in toluene and evaporated at 150^o^C for 24 h to
remove the solvent and unreacted monomer. Details of the synthesis
process are shown in Figure 1., and experimental details are shown
in Table 2.

**Preparations of elastomeric thermal pads from silicone resins and
h-BN**

The elastomeric thermal pads were formed with the thermoforming process,
as shown in Figure 2. The silicone resin was dissolved in toluene with a
weight ratio of resin to toluene of 10:1 before mixing with silicone
rubber. The mixing process took the form of mechanical stirring at
1000 rpm for 3 min and holding for 1 hour to ensure a homogeneous mixture.
Then, the *h*-BN particles were incorporated into the mixture. After the
mixing process, the mixture was placed in a stainless steel mold and
compression-molded at 90^o^C at a pressure of 1500 psi for 30 min in an
electrically heated hot-press machine (Taiwan: GF-50, You Found
Hydrolics Industrial Co. Ltd.). After the hot-press process, the
specimen was put in a drying oven at 150^o^C for 6 h. Detailed
experimental conditions are listed in Table 3.

## Characterization

The chemical structure analysis of the silicone resins was carried out by means of 
Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy using an FTS-1000
Infrared Spectrometer (Bio-Rad Digilab) in the frequency range of
4000-600 cm^-1^ in transmittance mode. Specimens were prepared using
the potassium bromide (KBr) pellet method with a weight ratio of resin to KBr
of 1:20. The molecular weight analysis of the silicone resins was determined
by ACQUITY Advanced Polymer Chromatography (APC, Waters Co.Ltd.) using
tetrahydrofuran as an eluent and polystryrene as standard. Crosslink
density (*V~e~*) was calculated based on the ASTM D6814 standard. The
Flory-Rehner equation for crosslink density: ^32^

> \(1\)

Where *V~e~* is the effective number of chains in a real network per unit
volume, *X~l~* is the polymer-solvent interation parameter (0.845), *V~l~*
is the molecular volume of the solvent (106.54X10^-3^ L mol^-1^) and *V~r~* is
the volume fraction of polymer in a swollen network in equilibrium with pure
solvent, is calculated as: ^33,34^

> \(2\)

where *w~dry~* is the weight of the dry rubber, *ρ~rubber~* is the rubber density,
*w~absorbed~* is the weight of solvent absorbed by the sample and *ρ~solvent~*
is solvent density. The thermal stability of the silicone rubber composite was
determined by thermogravimetry analysis (TGA Q500, TA Instruments) in
the range of 30 to 650^o^C with a heating rate of 10^o^C min^-1^ under
nitrogen flow at 40 mL min^-1^. The heat resistance of the material
(T~heat-resistance\ index~) ^18^ can be determined using the equation:

> \(3\)

Thermal conductivity was tested with a thermal conductivity analyzer
(Hot Disk TPS 2500S) using the transient plane source method, and following the ISO
22007-2 standard. The pads' mechanical properties were determined using a
universal tensile tester (Chun Yen Testing Machines, CY-6040A) with
weight loading of 500 kg and cross-head speed of 10 mm min^-1^, under the
ASTM D412 standard. The hardness was measured with a hardness tester
durometer, shore A type (Teclock, GS-709). The morphology of the silicone
resin and fractography of the silicone rubber composite were observed using
scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL JSM-6930LV). The samples were
platinum coated to enhance their conductivity with an auto fine coater
(JEOL JFC-1300) for 80 seconds. The density of the composite was determined
using the ASTM D792 standard. The mass loss and volatile content were
determined using the ASTM E595 standard. The flame resistance was determined
using the UL-94 standard. The resistivity of the composite was measured using
an ASTM D257 resistivity meter.

**Results and Discussion**

### **Chemical structure analysis**

Silicone resins were successfully synthesized using 
hydrolysis-polycondensation. Chemical structure analysis using
FTIR was performed to validate the synthesis results. The FTIR results
for Vi-MQT and Al-MQT are shown in Figure 3., and Figure 4.,
respectively. The broad peak at 3124 cm^-1^ indicates the existence of a hydroxyl group
from a residual silanol bond (Si-OH), which proves that hydrolysis 
occurred in the reaction. ^35^ The peaks at 2962 and 2902 cm^-1^ indicate
asymmetric and symmetric stretching of the methyl group. ^36^ The peak at
1402 cm^-1^ is representative of the unsaturated methyl group of the MQ
resin structure.^35^ The sharp peak at 1086 cm^-1^ indicates Si-O-Si
symmetric stretching in cyclic structures ^36^ represented as the Q unit in
the resin. The peaks at 1256, 845 and 756 cm^-1^ are indicative of the methyl
group from silanol that represents the M unit.^37,38^

Figure 4. FTIR spectra of MQ resin and Al-MQT resins.

In Figure 4., it can be seen that small peak appeared at 958 cm^-1^ that
refer to the out-of-plane C-H brand from the vinyl group. ^35,39^ This
peak has small intensity due to the small addition of vinyl group in
resin. Decreasing intensity trend of an unsaturated methyl group at 1402
cm^-1^ occurred with the addition of the vinyl group in resin structure.
The vinyltrisilanol structure reacted with residual silanol group from
siloxane prepolymer, compete simultaneously with trimethylsilanol. This
phenomenon also causes the disappearance of the peak at 3124 cm^-1^ in
highest vinyl content addition on the Vi-MQT resin. In Figure 5., it
clearly is seen that new broad peak revealed at 3460 cm^-1^, indicated
hydroxyl group that be expected from Al-OH. The peak at 1086 cm^-1^ also
be widened due to new peak revealed at 1060 cm^-1^ that indicated
asymmetric stretching Al-O-Si bond. ^27^ For a better understanding of
the difference of MQ, Vi-MQT and Al-MQT structure, comparison of FTIR
spectrum is shown in Figure 5. Based on the results, it can be concluded
that the silicone resins synthesis has been successfully done.

### **Molecular weight and morphology of silicone resins**

The molecular weight of silicone resins was listed in Table 4. The
number average and weight average molecular weight of MQ resin, Mn and
Mw, was 41301 g mol^-1^ and 47982 g mol^-1^, respectively, with narrow
molecular weight distribution (PDI) as 1.161. For Vi-MQT and Al-MQT
showed a similar decreasing trend of molecular weight with higher
addition of T unit in their structure. ^40^ Addition of T unit in MQT
structure decreases the Mn and Mw until 18906 and 28641 g mol^-1^,
respectively, for Vi-MQT and 17497 and 27114 g mol^-1^, respectively,
for Al-MQT. The decreasing trend of molecular weight was due to
increasing of the end-capping unit in the synthesis reaction. An
end-capped unit from M and T unit would react with silanol group from
siloxane prepolymer, caused the propagating process was stopped and
yielded a smaller size of the polymer. ^36^

### **Structure of crosslinked network**

The composite was characterized its structure, thermal stability and
mechanical properties. Incorporation of silicone resins would change the
crosslinked network structure of silicone rubber. The effect of addition
MQ resin on the crosslink density of silicone rubber is shown in Figure
6, and corresponding values are summarized in Table 5. From the results,
it can be seen that the density of silicone rubber did not change
significantly with the addition of MQ resin. The gel content, crosslink
density (*Ve*) and a molecular weight between crosslinks (Mc) of
silicone rubber were changed with the addition of MQ resin. Gel content
and *Ve* reduced with the addition of MQ resin, while the Mc increased
with the addition of MQ resin. The gel content of silicone rubber
decreased from 97.77% to 77.19% and *Ve* also reduced from 1.787X 10^-4^
until 0.735X 10^-4^, while Mc enhanced from 5901 to 14622 g mol^-1^ with
the addition of 30 phr MQ resin.

points of silicone rubber with addition of MQ resin.

**Table 5.** Network structure of silicone rubber with addition of MQ
resin.

Addition of MQ resin to silicone rubber was replaced with Vi-MQT and
Al-MQT resin to investigate its influence in the crosslinked network
structure of silicone rubber, as shown in Figure 7., and summary of its
value was listed in Table 6. The 10 phr of the silicone resin was
chosen. Addition of Vi-MQT reduced the gel content and *Ve* of silicone
rubber. Incorporation of Vi-MQT5 showed highest decline value of
crosslink density of silicone rubber, even it has a lower value than the
addition of 30 phr of MQ resin addition (0.642 X10^-4^ compared with
0.735 X10^-4^). For Al-MQT5 addition on silicone rubber showed similar
the crosslink density property like MQ resin (1.418 X10^-4^ compared
with 1.426 X10^-4^).

### **Thermal stability analysis**

Figure 8, showed the effect of MQ resin addition on thermal stability of
silicone rubber and the important characteristic thermal degradation
data were listed in Table 7. Increasing addition of MQ resin would
decrease the characteristic thermal degradation of silicone rubber. The
initial characteristic temperatures at 5% of weight loss decreased from
428.22^o^C for neat silicone rubber to 281.02^o^C for the addition of MQ
resin up to 30 phr. However, at 30% of weight loss, the characteristic
temperature of weight loss increased from 526.29^o^C for neat silicone
rubber to 596.54^o^C for the addition of 20 phr and then slight
decreased to 581.08^o^C for further addition (MQ-30). Temperature at
450-650^o^C is degradation of backbone structure region.^36,41,42^ In
silicone rubber/*h*-BN composite system, the addition of *h*-BN in
silicone rubber slightly increase its initial characteristic thermal
degradation. However, with the addition of MQ resin in all composition,
the thermal stability of the composite decreased. The initial
characteristic degradation temperature at neat silicone rubber/*h*-BN
composite is 429.56^o^C then decreased to 383.02, 329.31 and 294.12^o^C
for addition of MQ resin from 10 until 30 phr. Temperature of maximum
degradation rate increased with addition of MQ resin, from 507.85^o^C to
588.00, 584.24 and 572.94^o^C with addition of MQ resin from 10 to 30
phr, respectively. From the results, it can be concluded addition of MQ
resin decreased thermal stability of silicone rubber/*h*-BN composite.
Moreover, the residual yields of composites decreased with the addition
of MQ resin to 38.39%, which were far lower than neat composite
(64.75%).^17^

MQ resin.

Addition of MQ resin to silicone rubber was replaced with Vi-MQT and
Al-MQT resin to investigate its influence in the thermal stability of
silicone rubber composites, as shown in Figure 9, and summary of its
value was listed in Table 8. Addition of Vi-MQT resin to replace MQ
resin improved the initial characteristic thermal degradation of
silicone rubber. The initial characteristic temperatures at 5% of weight
loss decreased from 373.84^o^C to 235.15, 388.88 and 381.08^o^C for the
addition of Vi-MQT1, Vi-MQT3 and Vi-MQT5 silicone resin. For temperature
at 30% of weight loss, the temperatures slightly decreased to 563.67^o^C
at Vi-MQT1 addition from 578.04^o^C then increased to 590.43^o^C and
681.68^o^C for Vi-MQT3 and Vi-MQT5 addition. The corresponding
heat-resistance index showed similar trend with T~30~, from 243.21^o^C
of MQ resin addition to 239.24, 249.80 and 275.10^o^C for addition of
Vi-MQT1, Vi-MQT3 and Vi-MQT5 resin, respectively.

The temperature at 30% of weight loss also decreased from 578.04^o^C of
MQ resin addition to 573.65, 549.45 and 549.89^o^C for addition of
Al-MQT1, Al-MQT3 and Al-MQT5 resin, respectively. The corresponding heat
resistance index reduced from 243.21^o^C of MQ resin addition to 240.60,
233.18 and 228.93^o^C for addition of Al-MQT1, Al-MQT3 and Al-MQT5
resin, respectively, resulting lower thermal stability of silicone
rubber. Based on the results, it can be concluded that vinyl-silicone
resin effectively improved the thermal stability of silicone composite
compared with MQ, aluminum-silicone resins and even neat silicone
composite, with the best improvement with addition of Vi-MQT5 resin.

### **Mechanical properties analysis**

The effect of addition MQ resin on mechanical properties of silicone
rubber and silicone rubber/*h*-BN composite is shown in Figure 10. From
the results, it can be seen that addition of MQ resin in both of
silicone rubber and its composites significantly changed the mechanical
properties. Addition of MQ resin in silicone rubber reduced the tensile
strength and hardness but improved the elongation at break properties.
^43^ The tensile strength reduced from 2.099 MPa to 0.856 MPa on 30 phr
of MQ resin addition.

Incorporation of an *h*-BN particle in silicone rubber also reduced the
tensile strength of silicone rubber, from 2.099 MPa to 1.648 MPa, and
elongation of silicone rubber, from 737% to 657%. Addition of 10 phr MQ
resin slightly enhanced the tensile property, from 1.648 MPa to 1.659
MPa. Further addition of MQ resin (20 and 30 phr) even exceed the
tensile value of the neat silicone rubber/*h*-BN composite, as shown in
Figure 12 (a), however, its value is reduced compared with silicone
composite with addition of 10 phr MQ resin. In composites, structure
showed increment trends of elongation at break, due to the good
interfacial reaction between filler and matrix. Addition of MQ resin
also reduced the hardness properties both of silicone rubber and
silicone rubber/*h*-BN composites.

Figure 10. Mechanical properties of silicone rubber composites with
addition of MQ resin; (a) tensile strength, (b) elongation at break and
(c) hardness.

Addition of MQ resin to silicone rubber was replaced with Vi-MQT and
Al-MQT resin to investigate its influence on the mechanical properties
of silicone rubber and its composite with the *h*-BN particle, as shown
in Figure 11.The 10 phr of the silicone resin was chosen. It can be seen
that replacing MQ resin with Vi-MQT would reduced the tensile strength
of silicone rubber, from 1.862 MPa to 1.823, 1.777 and 1.530 MPa for
addition of Vi-MQT1, Vi-MQT3 and Vi-MQT5 resin, respectively. For
addition Al-MQT in silicone rubber/*h*-BN composite, the best value was
obtained by addition of Al-MQT3 with 1.711 MPa. The existence of
hetero-metal bond promoted synergy effect that can be dispersed
homogeneously in the oligosiloxane structure. ^41^ Addition of
vinyl-silicone resin enhanced the elongation property, from 808% with MQ
resin addition to 847, 877 and 987% for addition of Vi-MQT1, Vi-MQT3 and
Vi-MQT5 resin, respectively. Addition of aluminum-silicone resin
improved the elongation property, from 808% with MQ resin addition to
817, 870 and 867% for addition of Al-MQT1, Al-MQT3 and Al-MQT5 resin,
respectively. In composite system, addition of vinyl-silicone resin
gives better improvement on elongation at break property than
aluminum-silicone resin. Addition of Vi-MQT5 resin could enhanced up to
1063% while addition of Al-MQT3 only showed 793 % elongation, compared
with MQ resin addition at 731%. The hardness of silicone resin
significantly reduced with the addition of Vi-MQT resin, but slightly
enhanced with the addition of Al-MQT resin due to the existence of Al-O
bond in the structure.

Evaluation Performance of Silicone Rubber Composite

The thermal conductivity will enhance significantly with the existence
of high filler loadings. Addition of high filler does not only improve
the thermal conductivity property of silicone rubber but also some
properties will be affected, especially for its flexibility property.
Based on the preliminary results, MQ, Vi-MQT3 and Al-MQT3 resin were
chosen as a modifier of silicone rubber/*h*-BN to form a thermal pad.
Addition of silicone resin was made constant, at 10 phr. *h*-BN filler
concentration was increased up to 100 phr. The critical concentration
for percolation of cubical particles in polymer matrices is known to be
around 30% volume. The 100 phr filler concentration is higher than 30%
volume, ^14^ caused the silicone rubber matrix was saturated, prevent it
for being filled. The thermal pad was evaluated its performance based on
the target value of this study, as shown in Table 1.

### **Thermal conductivity**

The thermal conductivity property of thermal pads is shown in Figure 12.
It can be seen that the thermal conductivity of composite enhanced with
higher addition of filler loading. The thermal conductivity of composite
improved from 0.213 W m^-1^ K^-1^ in neat silicone rubber to 3.253 W
m^-1^ K^-1^ with the addition of 100 phr of the *h*-BN particle,
resulting 1427% enhancement of thermal conductivity. Addition of 20 phr
particle only resulted in 0.501 W m^-1^ K^-1^ of thermal conductivity
(135% enhancement). Addition of silicone resin improved the thermal
conductivity of silicone rubber composite. In neat silicone rubber, the
addition of silicone resin reduced its thermal conductivity, from 0.213
W m^-1^ K^-1^ to 0.189, 0.174 and 0.199 W m^-1^ K^-1^ with the addition
of MQ, Vi-MQT3 and Al-MQT3 resin, respectively. Addition of low *h*-BN
content (20 phr) resulting in a similar trend with the former result.
The existence of silicone resin in the structure of silicone rubber will
enhance the free volume and reduce the covalent bond which is a very
important aspect for thermal conduction mechanism in the polymer
material. Further addition of *h*-BN particle yielded higher thermal
conductivity on the composite with silicone resin compared with the
pristine one. The thermal conductivity improved from 3.253 W m^-1^ K^-1^
at composite without silicone resin addition to 3.611, 3.962 and 4.817 W
m^-1^ K^-1^ at composite with the addition of MQ, Vi-MQT3 and Al-MQT3
resin, respectively, at 100 phr filler concentration. The best
improvement of thermal conductivity was achieved by silicone composite
with Al-MQT3 resin. Higher thermal conductivity on silicone rubber
composite with Al-MQT3 resin was due to synergistic effect of *h*-BN
filler with silicon and aluminum atom in silicone resin structure. ^44^

Figure 12. Thermal conductivity of silicone rubber composites.

Mechanical properties

The mechanical properties of thermal pads were shown in Figure 13. The
tensile strength of silicone rubber decreased with the addition of
*h*-BN particle, from 2.099 MPa of neat silicone rubber to 1.248 MPa
with the addition of 100 phr particles. This is typical for composites
with poor interfacial interaction. ^13^ In high filler loading, an
incomplete dispersion of filler occurred and more defects were
formed.^18^ Therefore the tensile strength of silicone rubber/*h*-BN
composites was decreased. However in a composite system, composite with
silicone resin showed better tensile strength, as shown in Figure 15
(a). In high filler loadings (100 phr), the tensile strength of
composite improved to 1.274, 1.290 and 1.312 MPa for the addition of MQ,
Vi-MQT3 and Al-MQT3 resin, respectively. The elongation of silicone
rubber decreased with the addition of high *h*-BN loadings, from 737% of
neat silicone rubber to 22% of silicone rubber with 100 phr *h*-BN
particle. This behaviour is generally explained as the effect in the
lack of matrix/filler adhesion and poor filler distribution in the
matrix. ^45^ The hardness property increased with the addition of high
*h*-BN filler loadings, from 29 shore A of neat silicone rubber to 75
shore A of silicone rubber with 100 phr *h*-BN particle. Addition of
silicone resin slightly reduced the hardness of silicone rubber
composites. In high filler loadings, the hardness property reduces to
69, 71 and 72 shore A for the addition of MQ, Vi-MQT3 and Al-MQT3 resin,
respectively. Addition of MQ resin resulted in lowest hardness property
of silicone rubber composites.

**Density of Thermal Pads**

The density property of thermal pads are shown in Figure 14. It can be
seen that the addition of *h*-BN particle increased the density of
silicone rubber. The density increased from 1.054 g cm^-3^ at neat
silicone rubber to 1.418 g cm^-3^ with the addition of 100 phr *h*-BN
particle. This phenomenon naturally occurs due to differences in density
between the silicone rubber and *h*-BN filler. High filler loading will
increase the density of composites. Addition of silicone resin slightly
decreased the density of composite to 1.405, 1.407 and 1.411 g cm^-3^
for the addition of MQ, Vi-MQT3 and Al-MQT3 resin, respectively.

**Volatile Content of Composite**

The volatile content of thermal pads are shown in Figure 15. It can be
seen that the volatile content of silicone rubber reduced with the
addition of *h*-BN filler, from 0.963% of neat silicone rubber to 0.152%
of addition of 100 phr filler content. Addition of silicone resin in the
structure of composite increased the volatile content at 100 phr filler
addition to 0.196, 0.699 and 0.214% for MQ, Vi-MQT3 and Al-MQT3 resin,
respectively. Increasing of volatile content was due to the lower
crosslink density of silicone rubber compared with neat silicone rubber.

Figure 15. Volatile content of silicone rubber composites.

**Flame Resistance of Composite**

The flame resistance category of silicone rubber composites was listed
in Table 9. It can be seen that silicone rubber considerably flammable,
both in neat silicone rubber and silicone rubber modified with silicone
resins. Once being ignited, silicone rubber burns rapidly and release a
large amount of heat \[46\]. Addition of flame retardant material can
enhance its flame resistance. *h*-BN can be introduced into silicone
rubber to enhance its flame resistance property. Based on the result,
satisfying flame resistance of silicone rubber can be achieved with the
addition of more than 80 phr of the *h*-BN particle. Addition of silicone
resin did not give significant influence to flame retardancy property.

Table 9. Results of flame retardancy test of silicone rubber composites.

**Volume Resistivity of composites**

The volume resistivity of silicone rubber composites was listed in Table
10. It can be seen that composites with high addition of filler loading
enhanced its volume resistivity, from \>10^13^ to \>10^11^ Ω cm at 100
phr of *h*-BN. The existence of impurities and defects in the structure
also can enhance the volume resistivity of composite \[47\]. Addition of
silicone resin did not give significant effect to volume resistivity
property.

**Table 10.** Results of volume resistivity test of silicone rubber
composites.

### **Performance evaluation**

From the earlier discussions, the performance evaluation of silicone
rubber composite is shown in Table 11. It can be observed that silicone
rubber/*h*-BN composites possess good thermal conductivity, mechanical
properties and other properties. The density of composite with silicone
resin showed a slight reduction compared with the neat composite. The
density value for all of samples was lower than the predetermined limit.
The tensile strength of silicone composite was exceeds the expected
value and improve with the addition of silicone resin, the best
improvement was achieved by addition of Al-MQT3 resin. Silicone
composite without silicone resin showed low elongation at break, only
22%, as expected from poor compatibility between the silicone rubber and
*h*-BN particle. Addition of silicone resin successfully enhanced its
flexibility more than doubled, with the best improvement was achieved by
addition of Vi-MQT3 resin. The hardness of silicone composite achieved
the maximum predetermined value and the addition of silicone resin
slightly reduced the hardness with the best reduction by addition of MQ
resin. The thermal conductivity of composite achieved the predetermined
value and improve with the addition of silicone resin with the best
improvement by addition of Al-MQT3 resin. The volatile content of
silicone resin enhanced with addition of silicone resin due to the lower
crosslink density, however the value still below than the predetermined
limit. The flame retardancy and volume resistivity properties did not
change significantly with the addition of silicone resin and its value
still on a safe level. Based on the results, It can be concluded that
addition of silicone resin enhanced the properties of silicone composite
and satisfy all of predetermined target value in this research.

Table 11. Performance evaluation of silicone rubber composite modified
by silicone resin

**Morphology of composites**

The morphology of neat silicone rubber and silicone composite is shown
in Figure 16. It can be seen in Figure 16. (a), the morphology of neat
silicone rubber is plain and smooth. Addition of 20 phr of *h*-BN, as
shown in Figure 16. (b), the filler did not spread homogeneously, tend
to form agglomerates. This phenomenon was due to poor compability
between filler and matrix. Further addition of *h*-BN, as shown in
Figure 16. (c), the silicone composite showed rough surface due to the
existence of filler agglomerates and some void was formed among the
agglomerates. This condition leads to reduction of some properties,
especially mechanical properties.

Figure 16. Fracture morphology of (a) neat silicone rubber, and silicone
composite with (b) 20 phr and (c) 100 phr of filler addition.

The comparison of fracture surface morphology of silicone composite with
100 phr of *h*-BN filler is shown in Figure 17. Analysis of these images
reveals that agglomeration of *h*-BN filler and void generated when the
filler peeled off. In Figure 17. (a), it can be seen that the composite
has many defects and void, indicating poor compatibility between filler
and matrix.^47^ Matrix cannot be binding filler well, resulting in the
interfacial phase filled with air and yield poor composite properties.
The existence of air inside the composite would enhance the thermal
resistance of the material, resulting in ineffective of the heat
transfer process. Addition of silicone resin, as shown in Figure 17.
(b-d), showed better morphology than a pristine one. Silicone resin acts
as a bridge and enhance the adhesion property of silicone rubber,
resulting in better compatibility between filler and matrix. Better
compatibility will enhance its filler distribution and improved some
properties of the composite, especially for mechanical properties. The
high level of filler distribution is not always resulting in high
thermal conductivity. In Figure (c), it has the best filler distribution
and no filler agglomeration was formed. Compared with Figure (c), the
addition of aluminum-silicone resin as shown in Figure (d) showed filler
distribution is not too good, however, its thermal conductivity was
highest among the others. Regardless of the synergistic effect as
mentioned before, the high level of filler distribution will enhance the
interfacial interaction between filler and matrix, lead to increase of
thermal contact resistance. The effective way of heat transfer is from
filler-to-filler. It other words, filler agglomerations is needed to
accelerate the heat transfer process. Based on the morphology results,
Figure 17. (d) has some filler agglomerations with sufficient filler
distribution, resulting higher thermal conductivity.

# **Conclusions**

The silicone resin was synthesized using hydrolysis-polycondensation
method as a modifier for silicone rubber/*h*-BN composites. Three kinds
of silicone resin have been obtained i.e., MQ resin, vinyl-silicone
resin (Vi-MQT resin) and aluminum-silicone resin (Al-MQT resin).
Addition of vinyl- and aluminum-bond as functional unit reduced the
molecular weight of MQ resin due to shorter propagation process . The
thermal stability of Vi-MQT and Al-MQT resin was higher than MQ resin
due to higher bond dissociation energy, except Al-MQT5 resin. Both of
Vi-MQT and Al-MQT resin yielded higher residue content than MQ resin.
Addition of MQ unit only improved the thermal stability of composite
when the concentration is 10 phr. Addition of Vi-MQT and Al-MQT resin
enhanced the thermal stability due to crosslinking reaction and by
hetero-metal synergistic effect in silicone resin structure
respectively. When it applied on the composite system, silicone
composite with Vi-MQT resin showed higher thermal stability. Enhancement
on the characteristic temperatures at maximum degradation of silicone
composite with the addition of silicone resin indicated stronger
interaction between the silicone rubber and particles with the addition
of silicone resins. Increasing filler concentration of *h*-BN up to 100
phr enhanced the thermal conductivity and hardness composite up to 3.253
W m^-1^ K^-1^ and 75 shore A but reduced the tensile strength to 1.248
MPa and elongation 22% respectively. Addition of silicone resin improved
the thermal conductivity of composites, up to 3.661, 3.962 and 4.817 W
m^-1^ K^-1^ for MQ, Vi-MQT3 and Al-MQT3 resin, respectively. The tensile
strength improved up to 1.274, 1.290 and 1.312 MPa for MQ, Vi-MQT3 and
Al-MQT3 resin, elongation at break increased to 125, 188 and 150% , and
hardness 69, 71 and 72 shore A with the addition of MQ, Vi-MQT3 and
Al-MQT3 resin, respectively. The volatile content of composite increased
from 0.152% of the neat composite to 0.196, 0.699 and 0.214% for MQ,
Vi-MQT3 and Al-MQT3 resin, respectively. The density, flame resistance
and volume resistivity can change with the addition of silicone resins.
Addition of silicone resin slightly decreased the density of composite
to 1.405, 1.407 and 1.411 g cm^-3^ for the addition of MQ, Vi-MQT3 and
Al-MQT3 resin, respectively. Addition of silicone resin in the structure
of composite increased the volatile content at 100 phr filler addition
to 0.196, 0.699 and 0.214% for MQ, Vi-MQT3 and Al-MQT3 resin. *h*-BN can
be introduced into silicone rubber to enhance its flame resistance
property. It can be seen that composites with high addition of filler
loading enhanced its volume resistivity, from \>10^13^ to \>10^11^ Ω cm
at 100 phr of *h*-BN. In the future, the results can be used as a
breakthrough for developing new composite material as elastomeric
application and attract an interest of the industrial communities for
large-scale production.
