**Highlights**

-   A concentrated photovoltaic thermal model system with nanofluid
    spectral splitting was developed.

-   A 50-ppm ZnO nanofluid integrated with a
    well-designed model system is identified in providing 65.2 % overall
    energy conversion efficiency.

-   Nanofluid-based spectral splitting was employed in effective
    utilization of solar radiation intensity by a photovoltaic thermal
    system.

-   Numerical analysis of the nanofluid-based optical filtration
    photovoltaic thermal system was carried out.

-   It is shown that the CPV/T system electrical energy conversion
    was closer to quantum efficiency.

**Novelty**

Light beam focused by Fresnel lens to ZnO nanofluid flowing in
sequentially arranged filtering tubes of optimum diameter employed and
obtained energy conversion up to the quantum efficiency and overall
performance more than 50.35%.

-   **Why do you think the paper is important?**

The paper is important in designing an efficient energy conversion
system by focusing the sun into a proposed spectral filtering nanofluid
concentration and generating intended energy of interest with a system
efficiency of up to 85 %.

-   **Why the Journal publish**

The study could be published to transfer knowledge we studied for
effective light beam focusing, allocation, traveling of optimum distance
and uniform distribution, and thermophysical properties of the sample
used in the model.
