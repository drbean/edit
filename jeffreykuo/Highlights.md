**Highlights**

-   A concentrated photovoltaic thermal model system with nanofluid
    spectral splitting was developed.

-   A 50-ppm ZnO nanofluid integrated with a
    well-designed model system is identified in providing 65.2 % overall
    energy conversion efficiency.

-   Nanofluid-based spectral splitting was employed in effective
    utilization of solar radiation intensity by a photovoltaic thermal
    system.

-   Numerical analysis of the nanofluid-based optical filtration
    photovoltaic thermal system was carried out.

-   It is shown that the CPV/T system electrical energy conversion
    is close to quantum efficiency.

**Novelty**

A light beam focused by a Fresnel lens on a ZnO nanofluid flowing in
sequentially arranged filtering tubes of optimum diameter
obtained energy conversion up to quantum efficiency and overall
performance of more than 50.35%.

**Why do you think the paper is important?**

The paper is important for its design of an efficient energy conversion
system focusing solar radiation into a spectral filtering nanofluid
of proposed concentration and generating an intended energy of interest with a system
efficiency of up to 85 %.

**Why should the Journal publish the paper**

The study could be published to transfer the knowledge we have achieved of
effective light beam focusing, energy allocation, optimum extent of travel
of the light rays, their uniform distribution, and the thermophysical properties of the sample
used in the model.
