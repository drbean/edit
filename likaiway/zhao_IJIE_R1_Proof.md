Risk of Tripping, Minimum Foot Clearance, and Step Length When Crossing
a Barrier

**Abstract**

This study was designed to investigate the gait parameters upon crossing a
barrier and environmental factors influencing the perceived risk of
tripping. These factors included illumination and barrier conditions.
Barrier conditions were divided into height, type, and color of the
barrier. Illumination conditions included normal and dimmed conditions.
Twelve male participants were recruited. They walked on a walkway,
moving over a barrier. They gave a subjective rating of risk of tripping
(SRRT) both before and after the walk. A research assistant recorded a
gait disturbance rating (GDR) based on his observation of the gait of
the participant upon barrier crossing. The minimum foot clearance (MFC)
of both the leading and lagging foot when moving over the barrier, and
the step length of the participant before and after crossing the
barriers were calculated. The results indicated that the SRRT, both
before and after the walk, was significantly (*p*＜0.0001) higher when
the barrier height increased. Increased barrier height caused
significant (*p*\<0.0001) higher GDR. The barrier type (*p*\<0.01) and
illumination conditions (*p*\<0.001) had significant effects on the MFC of both
the leading and the lagging foot. The color (*p*\<0.05) and height
(*p*\<0.05) of the barrier also influenced the MFC of the lagging foot
significantly. Step length of the leading foot when crossing the barrier
was significantly affected by illumination condition (*p*\<0.001) and
barrier type (*p*\<0.05). The results of the study are helpful in
understanding the mechanisms brought into play when moving over barriers on walkways. They
provide meaningful information that will help in reducing trip and fall accidents.

1\. Introduction

Falls are common both in daily life and at work. They have led to
unintentional injuries globally (Hsieh et al., 2020; Hsu, 2016; Li et
al., 2019a; Wadhwaniya et.al., 2017) and have caused huge economic
losses to individuals and society (Amandus et al., 2012; Ramaswamy &
Mosher, 2018). The proportion of falls among all types of injury around the
globe increased from 23.1% in 1997-2007 to 27.7% in 2007-2017 (James
et al., 2018). In Taiwan and the United States during the period 2009 to 2018, the proportions of falls at work rose from 15.82% to 21.21%, and from
24.35% to 26.97% of all occupational injuries, respectively (BLS,
2019; OSHA, 2019). Falls occur because of slips, trips and loss of balance,
among other reasons. The literature has shown that tripping and
slipping are the main contributors of falls (Bentley & Haslam, 1999;
Berg et al., 1997). Tripping has been considered one of the main
precedent events that leads to falling for the elderly. More than a
third (35% to 47%) of elderly falls occur because of tripping (Berg
et al., 1997; Overstall et al., 1977). Thus, studying the mechanisms and
influencing factors in tripping will contribute significantly to efforts to improve the safety of both
the public and workers.

Previous studies have shown that the factors causing tripping can be
divided into two groups: unsafe environments and unsafe behaviors
(Huang et al., 2013; OSHC, 2018). Poor lighting conditions and improper
gait patterns when negotiating a barrier are examples of unsafe
environments and behaviors, respectively. Vision, affected by illumination
condition, has an influence on the stability of gait (Hallemans et al.,
2010; Logan et al., 2010). Visual information can help pedestrians to
control their limbs when moving over barriers (Patla & Vickers, 1997;
Patla & Greig, 2006). A person with poor vision may not see floor
conditions clearly and hence has a higher probability of tripping. Patla
and Greig (2006) found that the probability of tripping could reach as high
as 53% when walkers' views of floor conditions are blocked. Illumination 
is an environmental factor affecting vision and thus the risk of
tripping. The literature has indicated that the risk of tripping in a
dimmed environment is 15.5 times that under normal illumination
conditions (Li et al., 2019b). A pedestrian, for example, will not be able to visually
spot a pavement barrier if illumination is lower than a threshold
value (Fotios and Uttley, 2018).

In addition to illumination condition, walking speed also has an
influence on pedestrians\' ability to avoid obstacles in their path.
Pedestrians may not have enough time to adjust their gait when moving
over a barrier at a fast pace and this may lead to tripping
and falling. Walking speed upon moving over a barrier on the road
affects the gait pattern of the walker. The literature has shown that
flexions of the hip, ankle and knee increase significantly with 
increased pace when moving over a barrier (Draganich & Kuo, 2004;
Schulz, 2011).

Obstacles on the ground are surely undesirable. Berard and Vallis (2006)
requested their subjects to walk over one or two barriers in their
path. They measured the distance between the toe and the barrier when
moving over the barrier(s) and found that this distance in the
two-barrier condition was shorter than that in the one-barrier
condition. Lowrey et al. (2007) measured the time taken by participants
to move across barriers. Their results showed that the time to cross
the second barrier when there were two barriers was longer than that
to cross only one barrier. For barrier height, Garman et al. (2015)
found that the probability of tripping was positively correlated with
barrier height. In other words, high barriers lead to a high probability
of tripping. Chou and Draganich (1997, 1998) explored the influences of
barrier height on gait parameters of the trailing foot.
They found that the flexion angles of the hip and knee
increased significantly (*p*\<0.001) with barrier height when the toe of
the trailing foot was above the barrier. The stance time of the trailing
foot during the crossing step also increased significantly (*p*\<0.0001)
when the barrier height was raised. Similar results have been reported
by Pan et al. (2016).

Age and physical condition can influence the risk of tripping when
crossing a barrier. The literature (Huang et al., 2008; Novak and
Deshpande, 2014; Ribeiro et al., 2019) has shown that older participants
have lower center of pressure velocity of the stance foot and lower peak foot velocity
when the toe is above the barrier than younger ones. Older adults,
therefore, are more likely to trip than their younger
counterparts. In addition, the literature has found compensatory
mechanisms of the intact leg in the gait of lower limb amputees
(Silverman et al., 2008; Harandi et al., 2020). Individuals with
asymmetric gait patterns in their lower limbs have more difficulty
passing over obstacles on the ground and thus are at greater risk of
tripping.

Trips and falls may occur if a walker does not have sufficient foot
clearance when stepping over a barrier. One of the kinematic parameters
important in discussing risk of tripping (RT) is minimum foot clearance (MFC)
(Begg et al., 2007; Benson et al., 2019; Carter et al., 2020; Garman et
al., 2015; Loverro et al., 2013). This is the minimum space between the
lowest end of the foot of the swing leg and the ground or the top of a
barrier (Winter, 1991). When the minimum space occurs at the toe, it is
also called the minimum toe clearance (MTC). In other words, the MTC is
the shortest distance between the lowest end of the front part of the
shoe/foot and the floor or a barrier (Khandoker et al., 2007; Schulz,
2017). Determining the MTC (or MFC) is important in measuring the risk
of tripping especially for barrier crossing. Schulz (2011) found that
the MTC not only doubled with the presence of a visible barrier, but
also increased significantly with faster walking speed.

In addition to the kinematic parameters, subjective rating of risk of
tripping (SRRT), also called perceived risk of tripping, has been used
to estimate RT. Li et al. (2019b, 2020) have shown that the SRRT is
significantly affected by lighting condition and barrier characteristics,
specifically, its type, height, and color. However, they did
not examine the effects of lighting condition and characteristics of the
barrier on the MFC. Our hypothesis was that type, height, and color of
the barrier, and illumination condition were all significant factors
affecting both the MFC and step length upon barrier crossing. Our
purposes in this study were to test these hypotheses so as to increase our knowledge
of the kinematic mechanisms involved in tripping accidents. SRRT data and step
length before and after crossing the barrier were also investigated to
provide a more complete picture of gait behaviors in barrier crossing.

2\. Materials and Methods

We conducted the gait experiment in a laboratory where the temperature
and humidity were 19.0 (±4.6)℃ and 59.9 (±9.1)%, respectively.

2.1 Human participants

Twelve healthy male participants without a history of musculoskeletal
disease joined this study. Their age, body height, and body weight were
19.8 (±1.8) yrs, 174.3 (±5.2) cm, and 67.2 (±10.0) kg, respectively.
Their visual acuities were measured using a vision chart (Miao et al.,
1983). The decimal corrected visual acuities of the left and right eyes of the
participants were 0.78 (±0.41) and 0.70 (±0.39), respectively. Before
joining the experiment, the participants were instructed about the
purposes and procedure of the experiment. They then read and signed an
informed consent form. A local review board for human participant protection
approved this study (Jen-Ai Hospital, JAH109-46).

2.2 Walkway and Barriers

Selection of walkway and barriers followed the protocol established in the
literature (Li et al., 2019b). A walkway 6 m long was prepared. The
floor of this walkway was covered with dark gray ceramic tiles. Two
types of barrier were tested.  One was a steel stick (Ø0.8 cm) 80 cm
long. The other was a wooden board with a length of 60 cm and a
thickness of 1.5 cm. Two exemplars of both the stick and board were
prepared. One was a dark gray, the same color as the
floor surface. The other was white. The high contrast of the white stick and board,
as compared to the minimal contrast of the
gray stick and board, made them much more easy to see.

Stick and board barriers with a height of 5, 10, or 15 cm were tested.
For stick barriers, we placed two stands by the walkway to support the
stick (see Figure 1). For board barriers, we placed a board on the
walkway approximately 3.5 m from the beginning of the walkway. Both the
stick and board barriers were light and easily moved. This was done
so that participants would not trip and fall even if their feet touched the
barrier.

Figure 1. here

2.3 Illumination conditions

The experiment was performed under two illumination conditions: normal
and dimmed. The normal condition, with all the fluorescent
lights in the laboratory turned on, was a lighting level typical for
office work in local institutions. The dimmed condition, on the other
hand, was simulated by blocking all the windows and turning off all the lights,
except for the red LED lights on the cameras of the motion
tracking system. The illuminance of six spots near the barrier on the
floor was measured using an illuminance meter (TES-1336A; TES Electrical
Electronic Corp., Taiwan). The illuminance for the normal and dimmed
conditions was 169.4 (±3.7) lx and \<0.01 (±0.0) lx, respectively.

2.4 Motion Tracking System

A motion tracking system (VICON, T40S, UK) was adopted to capture the
motion of the feet of the participants. This system included eight
cameras. The 3D coordinates of this system were established and
calibrated. The filming rate was 100 Hz. Retroreflective markers (Ø1 cm)
were fixed on the ankles and shoes of the participants (see Figure 2).
The markers on the shoes were attached on the edges in the forefront and
the heel, and on the top front of the metatarsals of the big and pinky
toes. The 3D coordinates of these markers were captured to determine the
MFC and step length before and after moving across the barrier.

Figure 2. here

2.5 Experimental Procedure

Before the experiment, a research assistant explained to the
participants that trials would be carried out in normal and dimmed
conditions. They would wear a pair of rubber-soled shoes and walk on the
walkway with a barrier. The order of the illumination conditions,
barrier types, barrier heights, and barrier color was randomly
determined.

In the normal illumination condition, the participants stood at the
starting point of the walkway. They observed the walkway and rated the
risk of tripping (SRRT) on a scale from 1 - no risk to 5 - extremely
high risk. This rating was marked SRRT~b~. The participants then walked
toward the end of the walkway at a pace of 110 step/min following the
sound of a metronome. The 3D coordinates of the reflective markers on
their ankles and shoes were captured. After the walk, the participants
rated the risk of tripping again, based on their experience of barrier
crossing, using the same scale as in the SRRT~b~. This rating was
recorded as SRRT~a~. A gait disturbance rating (GDR) was recorded by a
research assistant based on his observation of the gait of the
participants upon barrier crossing using the scale: 1- no disturbance:
walked smoothly, 2- slight disturbance: walked slowing down slightly, 3-
medium disturbance: walked slowing down markedly, 4- serious disturbance:
stopped shortly before the barrier to adjust gait, and 5- foot-barrier
contact. Foot-barrier contact implies the onset of tripping.

In the dimmed condition, the participants, wearing an eye mask, were led
into the laboratory by a research assistant. The participants removed
the eye mask, followed the same procedure wearing the lab shoes and stood
at the starting point of the walkway and waited for approximately ten
minutes for dark adaptation to take place. They then reported their SRRT~b~ after
observing the pathway. Then, the participants followed the same
procedure walking along the walkway as in the normal illumination condition.

The MFC values were calculated using the 3D coordinates of the foot
markers (see Figure 3). The vertical distances from the toe and heel of
the leading foot to the top of the barrier when crossing the barrier
were calculated. The minimum of these two values was recorded as the
MFC~lead~. The vertical distance from the toe of the lagging foot to the
top of the barrier when crossing the barrier were also calculated and
was termed MFC~lag~.

Figure 3. here

The step length of five steps before and after crossing the barrier were
calculated using the 3D coordinates of the markers on the heel (see
Figure 3). Step 3 length (ST3) was the distance from the heel of the
leading foot to the heel of the lagging foot when crossing the barrier,
which occurred when the leading foot had just passed the barrier and the
lagging foot was still behind. Step 1 (ST1) and 2 (ST2) lengths were the
step length of two and one steps before crossing the barrier,
respectively. Step 4 (ST4) and 5 (ST5) lengths were the step length of
one and two steps after crossing the barrier, respectively (see Figure
4).

2.6 Data Analysis

Every participant walked under 24 experimental conditions (3
barrier heights×2 barrier types×2 barrier colors ×2 illumination
conditions) and was tested twice under the same experimental condition.
There were, therefore, a total of 576 trials. Means and standard
deviations of all the variables were calculated. The Kruskal-Wallis test
and Wilcoxon rank sum test were performed on all the SRRT and GDR data
to examine the significance of the variables comprising the experimental
conditions. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Duncan's multiple range test
were performed on MFC and step length data. The SAS^®^ 9.0 (SAS Institute
Inc., Cary, NC) software package was used for statistical analysis. A
significance level of α=0.05 was adopted.

3\. Results

3.1 Subjective Ratings

Figure 5 shows the SRRT~b~ statistics for the experimental conditions. The
Kruskal-Wallis test results reveal that the SRRT~b~ were significantly
affected by barrier heights (*p*\<0.0001). The SRRT~b~ of the 5 cm
condition (1.15±0.39) was significantly (*p*\<0.05) lower than that of
the 10 cm condition (1.89±0.56). The latter was significantly
(*p*\<0.05) lower than the SRRT~b~ of the 15 cm condition (2.48±0.62).
Illumination, barrier type, and barrier color, however, all
had an insignificant effect on SRRT~b~.

Figure 5. here

Figure 6 shows the SRRT~a~ results for the various experimental conditions. The
SRRT~a~ was significantly (*p*\<0.0001) affected by barrier height. The
SRRT~a~ of the 5 cm condition (1.43±0.71) was significantly (*p*\<0.05)
lower than that of the 10 cm condition (2.05±0.74). The latter was
significantly (*p*\<0.05) lower than the SRRT~a~ of the 15 cm condition
(2.68±0.73). Illumination, barrier type, and barrier color, again however,
all had an insignificant effect on SRRT~a~.

Figure 6. here

Figure 7 shows the GDR statistics under the various experimental conditions. The
effect on GDR was significant (*p*\<0.0001) in the case of barrier height. The GDR
of the 5cm condition (1.76±0.76) was significantly (*p*\<0.05) lower
than that of the 10 cm condition (2.33±0.63). The latter was
significantly (*p*\<0.05) lower than the GDR of the 15 cm condition
(2.89±0.66). The effects of illumination, type and color of barrier on
GDR were all insignificant, however.

Figure 7. here

3.2 Foot Clearance

The behavior of the MFC~lead~ under the experimental conditions is shown in
Figure 8. The ANOVA results show that the MFC~lead~ was
significantly affected by the barrier type (*p*\<0.01) and the
illumination condition (*p*\<0.0001). Posterior comparisons results
indicate that the MFC~lead~ of the stick barrier (126.15±44.78 mm) was
significantly (*p*\<0.05) higher than that (115.84±32.70 mm) of the
board barrier. The MFC~lead~ of the dimmed condition (128.85±40.90 mm)
was significantly (*p*\<0.05) higher than that (113.10±36.43 mm) of the
normal illumination condition. But, both barrier height and barrier color had
no significant effect on MFC~lead~.

Figure 8. here

Figure 9 shows the MFC~lag~ statistics under the experimental conditions.
The ANOVA results indicate that the MFC~lag~ was significantly affected
by the barrier type (*p*\<0.0001), illumination condition (*p*\<0.001),
barrier height (*p*\<0.05) and barrier color (*p*\<0.05). The MFC~lag~
for the stick barrier (132.12±47.24 mm) was significantly (*p*\<0.05)
higher than that (111.36±30.64 mm) for the board. The MFC~lag~ in the
dimmed condition (127.72±42.53 mm) was significantly (*p*\<0.05) higher
than that (115.69±38.74 mm) for normal illumination. The MFC~lag~ for the
dark gray barrier (125.45±41.43 mm) was significantly (*p*\<0.05) higher than
that (117.96±40.47 mm) for the white one. The MFC~lag~ for the 5 cm
barrier height (127.52±42.59 mm) was significantly (*p*\<0.05) higher
than that (117.17±41.49 mm) for the 15 cm condition. The differences in
the MFC~lag~ for the 10 cm condition (120.40±38.61 mm) with those for
the other two barrier height conditions were both insignificant (see
Table 1).

3.3 Step length

Figure 10 shows the results for ST3 under the experimental conditions. The
ANOVA results indicate that ST3 was significantly affected by the
illumination condition (*p*\<0.001) and barrier type (*p*\<0.05).
Duncan's multiple range test results showed that ST3 in the normal
illumination condition (733.33±54.69 mm) was significantly (*p*\<0.05)
longer than that (713.64±67.46 mm) under the dimmed condition. The ST3 in
the board barrier condition (728.72±62.73 mm) was significantly
(*p*\<0.05) longer than that (718.22±61.20 mm) in the stick barrier
condition. Both barrier height and barrier color had no significant
effects on ST3.

Figure 10. here

The ANOVA results indicate that the illumination condition was significant
for both ST1 (*p*\<0.01) and ST5 (*p*\<0.01). ST1 for the normal
illumination condition (674.37±44.48 mm) was significantly (*p*\<0.05)
longer than that (660.36±66.26 mm) for the dimmed condition. ST5 for
the normal illumination condition (669.31±49.70 mm) was also significantly
(*p*\<0.05) longer than that (658.15±49.13 mm) for the dimmed condition.
The effects of barrier height, type, and color on both ST1 and ST5 were
not significant (see Table 2).

Table 2 here

The ANOVA results indicate that none of the experimental factors had
significant effect on either ST2 or ST4.

Table 3 shows the multiple comparison results for the step lengths
before and after barrier crossing. ST3 was significantly (*p*\<0.05)
longer than all other lengths. ST2 was shorter (*p*\<0.05) than 
ST1 and ST3.

4\. Discussion

Barrier height has long been considered an important factor affecting RT
(Chen et al., 1991; Chou & Draganich, 1998; Garman et al., 2015;
Kunimune and Okada, 2017; Li et al., 2019b). And, in this study, all RT measures, namely the
SRRT~b~, SRRT~a~, and GDR, increased significantly (*p*\<0.0001) as the
barrier height increased, indicating that the higher the barrier,
the greater the perceived RT and gait disturbance.

Poor illumination is another environmental cause of
tripping and even falling (Huang et al., 2013). Nonetheless, in a previous
study (Li et al., 2019b) carried out in this laboratory, approximately a third of the participants
reported NO RISK before they walked in the dimmed condition and more
than 50% of the participants reported LOW RISK under the same condition. Similar results were
found in the current study. The participants made their SRRT~b~ judgments
primarily based on their visual evaluation of the walkway in front of them. The SRRT~a~, on the other
hand, was rated based on their experience of barrier crossing. The only
significant factor affecting both the SRRT~b~ and SRRT~a~ in the current
study was barrier height. Illumination, barrier type, and barrier color
were all insignificant. This was inconsistent with the findings in the
literature (Li et al., 2019b). The reason for this inconsistency might
be attributed to the use of the motion tracking system in the current
study. Each camera of this system was accompanied with a red LED light.
The cameras captured the reflective light of these LEDs on the markers.
Even though the illuminance on the six spots on the walkway was very low
(\<0.01 lx), it was still much higher than that (2.7×10^-3^ lx) in the
previous study (Li et al., 2019b). Therefore, our participants might
have better visions than those in Li et al. (2019b) and vision-related
factors such as color and type of barrier and illumination became
insignificant on the SRRT.

When moving over a barrier, the leading foot was in the front. The
participants could see the movement of this foot and could have better
control of this foot to cross the barrier. There was almost no MFC~lead~
difference among the 5 cm, 10 cm, and 15 cm barrier height conditions.
These results were consistent with those in Pan et al. (2016) and
Kunimune and Okada (2017). The participants probably estimated the
barrier height, and then controlled their leading foot to have a
constant MFC (approximately 120 mm) which would guarantee safety
crossing over the barrier. The lagging foot, on the other hand, was
behind the body. The participants could not see this foot and hence was
incapable to maintain the same MFC over different barrier height
conditions. This could explain why the MFC~lag~ was significantly
(*p*\<0.05) affected by barrier height (see Table 1).

Both the MFC~lead~ and the MFC~lag~ were significantly (*p*\<0.001)
affected by the illumination condition. The MFC~lead~ and MFC~lag~ in
the dimmed condition were significantly higher than those in the normal
condition by 15.75 mm and 12.03 mm, respectively. This finding was
consistent with those in the previous studies (Kunimune & Okada, 2017;
Rodrigues et al., 2009). Kunimune and Okada (2017) found that vision
condition affected the MFC of both the leading and trailing foot. The
participants tended to raise their foot higher when the illumination
condition was poor so as to reduce the probability of tripping.

When crossing the barrier, the MFC~lead~ in the stick condition were
significantly (*p*\<0.05) higher than that in the board barrier
condition by 10.31 mm, and the MFC~lag~ in the stick barrier condition
were significantly (*p*\<0.05) higher than that in the board condition
by 20.76 mm. When the barrier was a stick, the participants tended to
raise both of their leading and lagging feet higher upon crossing the
barrier than when the barrier was a board. This implies that barrier
type could affect the leg movements upon barrier crossing was consistent
with that in the literature (Li et al., 2019b).

ST3 (723.49±62.14 mm) was significantly (*p*\<0.05) longer than ST2
(657.08±91.44 mm) and ST4 (663.76±60.66). ST 2 was significantly
(*p*\<0.05) shorter than those of ST1 (667.36±56.81). Similar results
have also been reported (Berard & Vallis, 2006). This clearly indicated
that the participants reduced their step length one step in front of the
barrier for preparation to pass the barrier. They increased the step
length in the next step to guarantee safe crossing of the barrier.

The ST3 in the dimmed condition (713.64±67.46 mm) was significantly
(*p\<*0.0001) shorter than that in the normal lighting condition
(733.33±54.69 mm). This result was consistent with that in Berard and
Vallis (2006). They found that participants generally decrease their
step length when moving across the barrier in poor lighting condition.
Such a gait is one of the common gait strategies for safe walking. ST1
was the step lengths two steps before the participants crossed the
barrier. This step length in the dimmed condition was significantly
(*p*\<0.01) shorter than that in the normal lighting condition. This was
consistent with those in Novak and Deshpande (2014) where they found
vision condition affected the pre-barrier step length significantly. The
trajectory of the lead foot was planned at least two steps before
reaching the barrier (Timmis & Buckley, 2012). Our participants might
also start to adjust their gait two steps before crossing the barrier
especially when the illumination was poor. This was confirmed by our ST1
data especially in the dimmed condition.

ST3 was not affected by the barrier height. This was consistent with the
findings in the literature (Chen et al., 1991; Pan et al., 2016). On the
other hand, ST3 was significantly influenced by the barrier type
(*p\<*0.05). The ST3 in the stick condition (718.22±61.20 mm) was
significantly (*p*\<0.05) shorter than that in the board condition
(728.72±62.73 mm). The participants adopted conservative gait strategies
by reducing their step length upon barrier crossing when they
encountered stick barrier than when the barrier was a board. Such a
phenomenon was consistent to our outcomes in both MFC~lead~ and
MFC~lag~. There were a total of 576 trials in our experiment. Only 4
foot-barrier contacts occurred. Three of these cases occurred in the
stick condition. These implies that a stick on the walkway was more
likely to lead to a trip than a board. This was consistent with our
results of MFC~lead~ and MFC~lag~, and was also consistent with the
findings in the literature (Li et al., 2019b).

This were limitations of this study. First of all, we assumed that the
friction of the floor was not a significant factor affecting the RT upon
barrier crossing when the shoe-floor interface was slip-resistant. Our
rubber-soled lab shoes were believed to be slip resistant on the walkway
even though the friction coefficient between the shoe sole and floor was
not measured. Future research may be needed to test more combinations of
shoes and floor material. Secondly, only two types of barriers under
three heights were tested. Many other types of barrier with different
heights could appear on the walkways both at work and in the public
sector. Our results cannot be generalized in explaining the RT and MFC
phenomena beyond our experimental conditions. Studying the effects of
barrier types and heights, other than those adopted in the current
study, on the risk of tripping may be interesting topic in the future.
Finally, we have tested only a young male sample. The effects of gender
and age group of human participants on the SRRT and MFC could also be
interesting research topics in the future.

5\. Conclusions

Our hypotheses were partially supported. The MFC of the lagging foot was
significantly affected by illumination condition and type, height, and
color of barrier while the MFC of the leading foot was significantly
affected only by illumination condition and barrier type. This implies
that participants had better control of their leading foot than their
lagging foot considering the environmental conditions in our experiment.
The step length upon barrier crossing was also significantly affected
only by illumination condition and barrier type. This may imply that the
participants adjusted the step length upon barrier crossing primary
because they found changes of those two factors. The findings of this
study enhance our understanding of human gait upon barrier crossing
which will be beneficial for the prevention of tripping and falling.
