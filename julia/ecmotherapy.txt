Abstract

With the continuing development of medical technology and accumulation of clinical experience, extracorporeal life support systems, also called extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (hereafter, ECMO), have become widely used with patients suffering heart/lung failure or in intensive care, because the procedure creates more opportunities for the affected organ's treatment and provides more time for its recovery, thereby increasing survival rates. However the complications that ECMO leads to can affect the patient's daily life functioning, lengthen the period taken to recuperate and create psychological distress, lowering the quality of life.

Research overseas has indicated that the psychological well-being of critically ill patients undergoing ECMO-assisted treatment, the possibility of this affecting their prognosis, the anxiety, depression, and psychological trauma they experience on discharge from hospital and the effect of this anxiety, depression and anxiety on their quality of life are all subjects that deserve attention. However, until now research studies in Taiwan have mostly focused on the analysis of factors predicting survival and discharge from hospital of patients who have received ECMO-assisted treatment and have not yet investigated the effect of anxiety, depression, and psychological trauma on their quality of life. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate to what extent patients receiving ECMO-assisted treatment suffer these conditions and the effect these have on their lives.

It is 20 years since the first ECMO procedure was performed in Taiwan in 1994. Of the 737 cases recorded at a medical center in northern Taiwan, from the center's first in April 19, 2006 through December 31, 2015, 255 patients (237 of whom were adults) survived and were discharged. This study employed a descriptive, correlational and cross-sectional research design, and used convenience sampling and structured questionnaires to collect dimensional data. The questionnaires included the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Impact of Event Scale - Revised (IES-R), the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36-Item Health Survey, and the EQ-5D-3L. The collected data was converted into dimensional data and analyzed with the SPSS 22.0 for Windows package. Descriptive and inferential statistics, including independent t-tests, Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients and linear regression coefficients, were calculated. 

This study hopes, by means of its large database and adequate number of cases, to provide for multi-faceted medical treatment and nursing care for ECMO patients that takes into account the physical, psychological, and social ramifications of the complex physiological issues that they face. It also hopes to expedite the planning of action programs for clinical treatment of ECMO patients, and to allow, by comparison with research results overseas, evaluation of the quality of Taiwanese treatment and care.
