I. Rationale and background
In 2013, the number of patients readmitted to the hospital's psychiatric ward within 60 days totaled 80, for a readmission rate of 14.55%, 1.86 times the 2012 readmission rate of 7.81%. These readmissions not only created a burden for the patients and their families, and a waste of medical treatment resources for the hospital, they also increased clinical nursing staff's feelings of ineffectiveness. Accordingly, the unit was motivated to develop a series of improvements.

II. Problem structure and countermeasure investigation
貳、問題結構與對策措施探討：
An analysis of returns from a survey conducted from February 15 to February 28, 2014 showed 
2014年02月15日至02月28日進行回收問卷相關分析發現：病人再入院與病人因素佔49.78％為最主要原因，其次是病情因素佔33.48％，而醫療處置相關因素則佔16.74％（表一）。而主要因素的病人因素中發現病人病識感不佳佔18.94％、未遵從醫囑及未定時返診服藥佔13.22％、家庭因素（無法照顧、喘息服務）佔10.57％、前次要求自動出院佔7.05％。經現況調查資料及特性要因分析後，確認問題為精神病人再住院率高14.55％，其主要原因有：病人病識感不佳，出院衛教未落實。

III. Development of countermeasures
On the basis of the analysis of the situation and a review of the relevant literature, a project team put forward a proposal for a six-point program to resolve the situation, developed using a decision-making matrix diagram. It was decided to accept and implement:
 1. Ward discharge preparation service records. Consulting the literature, a Ward Discharge Preparation Service Record form was drawn up for the unit. Its content included needs evaluation, in-hospital patient education, on-discharge instruction, date of discharge, and condition on discharge and prognosis items, among others. This allowed clinical nursing staff's patient assessments at the time of admission to form a basis for patient discharge preparation services.
 2. An on-discharge medication education process. The writing up of what the patient should be told when he/she took medication home at the time of discharge, and promotion of the implementation of on-discharge medication education and its importance were planned and prepared.
 3. In-hospital medication education groups. Following discussion with the unit pharmacist, and having confirmed the group's topic, regular routine monthly medication education groups were arranged.

IV. Results
 1. Readmission rates: On the basis of July discharges of 45 and September discharges of 49, the 60-day readmission rates were 6.67% and 18.37% respectively, for an average of 12.52%, reaching 13.95% of the project goal.
 2. Patient education completion rates went from 44% to 96%, or 122.72% of the project goal. 【（98.0-44.0）/（44.0）*100%=122.72％】。
 3. Medication group education satisfaction rates: The unit medication education groups met regularly twice a month from April, 2014. For the 59 people participating in 10 meetings, there was an average satisfaction rating of 87.56%.

Setting up a psychiatric discharge preparation service record system, this project improved the on-discharge medication education process, increased regular in-hospital medication education groups and reduced the 60-day readmission rate to 12.52%. Nurses also increased patient education completion rates to 98%. Even if readmissions were not completely eradicated, by means of the project nursing staff could evaluate patients' individual needs at readmission time, then promptly proceed with appropriate patient education and guidance and, *with the cooperation of pharmacists, carry out cross-group medication instruction in the patient education groups* while they were in the hospital, and finally re-plan appropriate discharge instructions for the medication taken home at discharge time. Colleagues felt that after the institution of the project the treatment of patients at discharge time provided complete care.
本專案藉由制定精神專科性出院準備服務紀錄單，改變出院藥物衛教流程並增加住院期間藥物衛教團體，降低了病人60日內再入院率至12.52％，護理人員衛教執行率可上升至98％，雖無法完全避免病人再入院，但是藉由此專案，護理人員再病人一入院時可依病人個別需求進行評估，於住院期間即可進行相關衛教指導，住院期間跨團隊藥師合作進行藥物衛教團體，出院時護理人員再針對病人出院帶藥進行再次提醒執行相關衛教，同仁反應專案進行後，辦理病人出院時感覺完整照護。
