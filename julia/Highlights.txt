Highlights
(1) Students receiving an interactive model of reading instruction focusing both the bottom-up and top-down reading processes (i.e. the experimental group) outperformed those having the instruction emphasizing sorely the bottom-up reading process (i.e. the control group) in reading comprehension. 
(2) No significant difference was found between two conditions on the 2-month delayed posttest.
(3) Students had a positive attitude towards the interactive model.
