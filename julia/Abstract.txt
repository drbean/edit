Abstract
There has been a continuing emphasis on exploring how learners’ background knowledge influences reading comprehension. In view of the paucity of published research in the field, this research fills a gap in understanding the relationship between the two in nursing. A teaching program with a pretest-intervention-posttest design where the intervention was instruction based on an interactive model of reading was delivered in a nursing college in Taiwan in 2015. Two intact classes of students participated in this study and were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: the experimental group (n=57) and the control group (n=56). In the former, students were taught through an interactive model of reading, which emphasised the dynamic interrelationship of data-driven, bottom-up and concept-driven, top-down reading while in the latter the teaching  was based on a bottom-up teaching approach. A reading comprehension test and five unit tests were used to measure the treatment effects. Statistical analysis revealed that the experimental group performed significantly better than the control group in the reading comprehension test and the unit tests. However, in the delayed reading comprehension posttest, the performance of the two groups was comparable. In other words, the reading competence of the experimental group was no more effective than that of the control group, indicating possibly only short-term benefits with the interactive model.
