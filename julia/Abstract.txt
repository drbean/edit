Abstract
There has been a growing emphasis on exploring how learners’ background knowledge influences reading comprehension. In the nursing field, considering a paucity of published research exploring the relationship between the two, this research aimed to fill this gap. A teaching program with the pretest-intervention-posttest design concerning the aim was designed in a nursing college in Taiwan in 2015. Two intact classes of students participated in this study and were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: the experimental group (n=57) and the control group (n=56). In the former, students were taught through an interactive model of reading instruction, which emphasised the dynamic process between data-driven bottom-up and concept-driven top-down reading while in the latter the teaching procedure was based on a bottom-up teaching approach. A reading comprehension test and five unit tests were used to measure the treatment effects. The analysis revealed that the experimental group performed significantly better than the control group in the reading comprehension test and the unit tests. However, in the delayed reading comprehension posttest, the performance of the two groups was comparable. In other words, in the absence of the model, the reading competence of the experimental group was no more effective than that of the control group.
