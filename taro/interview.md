This interview by singer-songwriter and actor, Ogaki Tomoya, on the occasion of a performance for the Tenkawa Benzai shrine, was published in the July issue of Entame News, 2017.

Ogaki: You've performed many times at temples and shrines. Is the feeling different than at other times?
Matsumoto: With the band, Shanion, we had before, we used to give a dedicatory performance every month on the full moon at Shin-yakushiji temple. We did this for 6 years, playing more than 50 times there. Even now, I perform every year at Mizumuro Jinja. Playing before the gods, or for someone who has died and is no longer physically present, you strive to make the mind clear, yes.
