You're proably not interested in having a paper edited, but you may be approached by researchers who are.

I teach in the Language Center at NUU, where I have edited the papers of 阮瑞祥 and other researchers. But I also wish to offer more widely my academic paper editing service, "the next best thing to a journal editor at your side ON your side."

I do a good job because of i) my English language skills (see my old GRE scores in my resume), ii) the care with which I express myself, and iii) my desire to understand even difficult material.

I highly recommend Greg's professionalism in editing--呂宜玲
I appreciate Greg's editing ability and discussions of English grammar--董東錦

Please feel free to contact me, just to say, "Hello", even if you don't want me to edit your work.

See my resume at http://drbean.sdf.org/ResumE.html
See my thoughts on the work of the editor at http://drbean.sdf.org/sentence_and_text.pdf
See my work on a paper about an experimental intervention in education, http://drbean.sdf.org/q-technique.html
See a cover letter I sent to Wallace Editing Services, http://www.editing.tw, in application for a freelance editing position at http://drbean.sdf.org/wallace_cover_letter.txt

Let me share two excellent writing sites:

1. GMU's writing guides, developed for college students, have good advice about the process of writing.

See the comments on the academic paper's Introduction, Method, Results and Discussion sections:

https://writingcenter.gmu.edu/guides/imrad-reports-introductions
https://writingcenter.gmu.edu/guides/writing-an-imrad-report
https://writingcenter.gmu.edu/guides/imrad-reports-conclusions

2. Academic Phrasebank gives you the words to say what you are trying to do at certain points in your paper.

For example, hedges, as explained by https://writingcenter.gmu.edu/guides/hedges-softening-claims-in-academic-writing

The Academic Phrasebank suggests when you want to be cautious about interpreting results, http://www.phrasebank.manchester.ac.uk/using-cautious-language/, you can say:

	These data must be interpreted with caution because …
	These results therefore need to be interpreted with caution.

People in Taiwan have been very generous to me, I have for many years benefited from free software and I always appreciate vendors who offer good service at low prices, so I want to return the favor by keeping to the rock-bottom recommended 國家科學委員會 rate of 0.5元 per word.

Thanks for reading this far. I look forward to hearing from you.
