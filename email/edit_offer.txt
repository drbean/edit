I teach in the Language Center at 聯合, and I hope to be running a lunchtime Writing Workshop at the center for students next semester. But in this email to you, I'm advertising my Academic Paper Editing Service, "the next best thing to a journal editor at your side ON your side."

I do a good job because of i) my English language skills (see my resume), ii) the care with which I express myself, and iii) my desire to understand even difficult material.

I highly recommend Greg's professionalism in editing--呂宜玲
I appreciate Greg's editing ability and discussions of English grammar--

Please feel free to contact me, just to say, "Hello", even if you don't want me to edit your work.

See a cover letter I sent to Wallace Editing Servics <a href="http://www.editing.tw">http://www.editing.tw</a> in application for a freelance editing position at http://drbean.sdf.org/wallace_cover_letter.txt

Let me share two excellent writing sites:

GMU's writing guides, developed for college students, have good advice about the process of writing.
