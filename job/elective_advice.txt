I'm sending this email to all the full-time Language Center teachers.

Next semester I will need to offer an elective course to get the full 8 hours allowed for part-time teachers.

My experience with elective courses is that they are often canceled because not enough students enrol and the students who do enrol are not enthusiastic about what they are studying.

I would like to teach a popular course (I need the money ;-). What advice do you have for an elective that would appeal to a good number of students and that they would like to study?

I've never taught a test preparation class. That might be interesting for me. But I wonder how many students would be interested in signing up.
