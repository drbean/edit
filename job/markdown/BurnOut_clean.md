title: 'BurnOut - Kwiki'
---

I was reading about
[Bobby Fischer ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_fischer,)
who stopped playing chess after becoming world champion, and wondered
why I haven\'t suffered from burn-out as a teacher of English as a
Foreign Language.

Burn-out is the experience of long-term exhaustion and diminished
interest in your work, often the result of spending of too much energy
in intense social interactions in jobs like teaching and nursing.
[Burnout on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnout_(psychology))

Perhaps burn-out\'s the result of too much success, or conversely, the
inability to see that \'success is going from failure to failure without
loss of confidence\' (Winston Churchill).
