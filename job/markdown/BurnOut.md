| becoming world champion, and      |                                   |

| Burn-out is the experience of     |                                   |
| long-term exhaustion and          |                                   |
| diminished interest in your work, |                                   |
| often the result of spending of   |                                   |
| too much energy in intense social |                                   |
| interactions in jobs like         |                                   |

| Perhaps burn-out\'s the result of |                                   |
| too much success, or conversely,  |                                   |
