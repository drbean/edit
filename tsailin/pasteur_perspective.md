**Reconciling Conflict between Knowledge Creation and Knowledge
Utilization at Entrepreneurial Universities: A Pasteurian Orientation
Perspective**

**Abstract**

This paper develops the concept of the Pasteurian orientation (PO) as the best approach
to understanding reforms by university departments of their organizational strategies
and structures to foster both knowledge creation and knowledge
utilization in the new era of the entrepreneurial
university. We put forward a model and four
major hypotheses that posit PO as a mediator between a department's organizational
antecedents and collective departmental efficacy. The paper reports a dataset of responses from 634
department administrators and non-administrative faculty members from 99
departments at six Taiwanese universities collected via a postal questionnaire
survey. Regression results indicate that organizational munificence
and organizational flexibility, as contextual antecedents, are
positively associated with a department's PO development, at the same time as knowledge
creation is a significant contributor to development of knowledge utilization.
PO development is also positively associated with departmental collective
efficacy, and balancing knowledge creation and knowledge utilization
by means of PO development has a positive mediating effect on the relationship
between contextual antecedents and this collective efficacy. The paper
concludes that developing the PO of university departments acts as a crucial
factor in facilitating their role in the transformation from traditional university
into entrepreneurial university. Policy and managerial implications are
also suggested.

**1. Introduction**

The rise of entrepreneurial universities in the past few decades has
stimulated investigation by researchers studying the new economics of science
(Merton, 1968; Partha & David, 1994; Stokes, 1997), 
university-industry linkages (D'Este & Patel, 2007; Stankiewicz, 1986),
the triple helix model (Etzkowitz & Leydesdorff, 2000), and academic
entrepreneurship (Etzkowitz, 2003; Shane, 2004). They have elaborated how, with reforms in
science and technology policy, universities have gradually developed
multiple infrastructures with closer and more productive relationships
with industry in order to provide a more fundamental economic and social
contribution to society (Etzkowitz, 1998).

When universities are encouraged to develop entrepreneurial habits, they
still face severe problems balancing old and new missions,
choosing between knowledge creation and knowledge utilization, and finding traditional and new
sources of support (Clark, 2004; Van Looy et al., 2011). Although the
tensions impede the transformation of traditional universities into more
entrepreneurial ones, many universities have attempted to create favorable
contexts for these dual tracks by providing new
organizational changes, including in university leadership, climate, formal
incentives, technology transfer office support, and 
faculty engagement promotion (Klofsten et al., 2019; Perkmann et al., 2013).

Stokes (1997) advocated use-inspired basic research, calling it Pasteur's
quadrant research, and encouraged academia to develop a balance between work on
knowledge creation, for the purpose of exploring understanding of natural phenomena, and work on knowledge
utilization, to the end of exploiting scientific knowledge for its practical use. However, Pasteur's
quadrant provides little insight into how organizational structures,
strategies, and processes can be created so both knowledge creation and
knowledge utilization can be pursued in universities simultaneously. Tackling
organizational development, other researchers have argued that ambidextrous structures could be established by an organization
to coordinate a mix of
activities that foster both exploration and exploitation (He & Wong, 2004;
Lavie, Stettner, & Tushman, 2010), research publication and research
commercialization (Chang, Yang, Martin, Chi, & Tsai-Lin, 2016) , or
alignment and adaptability (Gibson & Birkinshaw, 2004; Raisch &
Birkinshaw, 2008; Tushman & O\'Reilly, 1996). In any case, universities
need to develop a *Pasteurian orientation (PO)* to establish a balance between
knowledge creation and knowledge utilization and respond to the call for an
entrepreneurial professoriate, inspired by the concept of
Pasteur's quadrant and organizational ambidexterity. This will allow
universities following the new organizational practices of the entrepreneurial
university to facilitate collective action by faculty members, as it builds their
efficacy beliefs and convinces them of the value of engaging
in academic-industry cooperation (Aschhoff & Grimpe, 2014; Jain, George, & Maltarich, 2009).

As a focal unit in the work of a university, a university department plays an
influential role not only with its achievements in knowledge creation and
knowledge utilization but also in its identity as an illustrated organizational cognitive complex
reshaping the behaviors of the group and the individual (Gustafsson &
Autio, 2011). Therefore, the aim of this study is to explore the relations among
a university's context, PO development, and collective efficacy at
the university department level, linking those achievements with its identity. The paper is organized as follows. After
an introduction, a theoretical framework connecting organizational
antecedents, PO construct, and collective efficacy is proposed. Thirdly,
data, variables, and data analysis are presented. Descriptive
statistics, correlations, and regression models are included. Finally, 
our empirical research results are discussed and compared to those of previous studies.
Conclusions and implications are presented.

**2. Theoretical Model**

**2.1 The rise of and conflicts in the entrepreneurial university **

Contributing to the initiative to develop entrepreneurial universities, proponents of *the new
economics of science approach* argued that university researchers could not
only be involved in knowledge creation but could also support the development
of knowledge applications with an economic benefit (Nelson, 2004;
Partha & David, 1994; Stokes, 1997). For their part, advocates of *the triple-helix
approach* emphasized that developing an entrepreneurial university could
promote effective interaction between academia, industry, and
government and result in better regional and national innovation systems
supporting industrial innovation (Etzkowitz, 2003; Shane, 2004). In
other words, the call for entrepreneurial universities implied that the
professoriate should transit to new organizational trajectories 
and embrace a third mission, coordinated alongside the traditional ones of teaching and research, of
commercializing work that would have a social
and economic impact meeting the expectations of society (Chang et al., 2016; Clark, 1998; Etzkowitz, 2017).

However, development of the entrepreneurial university leads in directions that are
in tension with the traditional goals and norms of science (Ambos,
Mäkelä, Birkinshaw, & D\'Este, 2008; Haas & Park, 2010; Jain et al.,
2009; Philpott, Dooley, O\'Reilly, & Lupton, 2011). The critical problem
is the inherent conflict between traditional academic paradigms (e.g., talent
training, publishing academic results, and pursuing academic reputation)
and industrial or entrepreneurial ones (e.g., consulting, contract
research, patenting and licensing research results, spin-off
formation, and pursuing economic and societal returns). From the
organizational development perspective, the two paradigms have different
organizational settings at the two ends of a spectrum of scientific
work (Philpott et al., 2011; Sauermann & Stephan, 2013). Academic logic
implies a focus on basic and curiosity-oriented research (Ambos et al.,
2008). Industrial logic, relatively speaking, leads to undertakings involving less risk and more direct
commercial research. Second, the two follow different norms of knowledge
dissemination (Kalar & Antoncic, 2015). Academic logic tends to
encourage open disclosure and contribution to the scientific commons. On
the other hand, industrial logic seeks beneficial ownership and
privatization of intellectual property. These organizational conflicts
may impede universities' moves towards a more entrepreneurial
orientation, and much effort may be needed to encourage universities to
engage in research commercialization (Bercovitz & Feldman, 2008; Haas &
Park, 2010; Jain et al., 2009).

**2.2 Pasteurian orientation: Combining Pasteur's quadrant and
organizational ambidexterity**

In creating entrepreneurial universities, coordinating the conflict in
an organizational setting between the academic and industrial logics is
critical work. Stokes (1997) proposed a framework that helps here,
transforming the straight-line spectrum along which the strategic direction of
scientific research ranges into a two-dimensional quadrant model. Stokes (1997) folded the two
ends of the line model into the two orthogonal axes of a quadrant model. One axis is
knowledge creation, which means enhancing our understanding of the
world and pushing back the frontiers of knowledge. The other one is knowledge
utilization, which means resolving specific technical or social problems
and realizing the market potential of innovation (Figure 1).

\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\--

Insert Figure 1 Here

\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\--

Research in the upper-left cell, referred to as *Bohr's quadrant*, is
basic research pursued with little consideration of its practical
application. The lower-right cell, called *Edison's quadrant*,
characterizes research directed towards technological development which
seeks more efficient knowledge utilization. The lower-left
quadrant Stokes (1997) called Peterson's quadrant and indicates research
that neither creates new knowledge nor extends the use of existing knowledge. Finally,
in  *Pasteur's quadrant* is
use-inspired basic research, which Stokes (1997) proposed academic
scientists should be encouraged to pursue, both exploring scientific understanding
and exploiting it as technology to meet practical needs.

Universities moving in the direction of
Pasteur's quadrant need to create ambidextrous structures and
contexts that can underpin the pursuit of research excellence and research commercialization
simultaneously (Tushman and O'Reilly,
1996; Raisch and Birkinshaw, 2008).  In a re-conceptualization of Pasteur's quadrant and
organizational ambidexterity that extends analysis of these ambidextrous structures and contexts, this paper argues Pasteurian Orientation
(PO) includes two sub-orientations: a knowledge creation orientation
(KCO) and a knowledge utilization orientation (KUO), creating a two-dimensional surface on which the
major activities which distinguish an
entrepreneurial university can be mapped. Moreover, we posit the effect of the two orientations is multiplicative and that PO is equivalent to the
knowledge creation orientation multiplied by the 
knowledge utilization orientation, as shown in
Equation 1 (Gibson & Birkinshaw, 2004). Conceptually, the PO could be
regarded as *the organizational propensity to develop organizational
strategies, processes, and structures to achieve, simultaneously,
knowledge creation and knowledge utilization*.

PO= KCO\*KUO..............................Equation 1

Furthermore, each sub-orientation consists of *organizational support*
and *faculty engagement*. *Organizational support* is associated with
organizational resources, incentives, and supervisor and colleague
consensus (Bercovitz & Feldman, 2008; Datta, Mukherjee, & Jessup, 2015)
to support knowledge creation and knowledge utilization. *Faculty
engagement* represents faculty members' intentions and capabilities
regarding time, awareness, experience, and research portfolios in
their knowledge creation and knowledge utilization activities (Chang, Yang, & Chen,
2009; Jain et al., 2009). We can draw a figure to illustrate the
composition of PO (Figure 2).

**2.3 Contextual antecedents**

In the creation of the entrepreneurial university, university departments are
the meso-level unit standing between the institutional contexts of the university
and its faculty members, performing a crucial role in integration and engagement in
the changing university paradigm (Ambos et al., 2008; Chang et al., 2016;
Gibb, Haskins, & Robertson, 2013; Jain et al., 2009). Jain et al. (2009)
argue that universities with appropriate environmental contexts will
encourage internal actors to respond to the transformation of the
university paradigm (Perkmann et al., 2013). And organizational studies have found
organizations characterized by greater environmental munificence are more
open to adopting new strategies and structures, even stabilizing new
practices in turbulent environments (Boyne & Meier, 2009; Keats & Hitt,
1988). The level of munificence here refers to the availability of resources
and support in the environmental context which could help an
organization adopt new practices to sustain organizational growth and
changes (Dess & Beard, 1984; Goll & Rasheed, 2005; Haveman, 1993). To
create the entrepreneurial university, Clark (2004) suggests that a
managerial group can provide a sustainable commitment to the new
university paradigm to encourage internal actors to build an
integrated context that will respond to the changes. O'Reilly and Tushman
(2008) point out that senior managers can adapt, integrate, and
reconfigure organizational skills and resources to orchestrate both
new and existing routines suitable for the changing environment. Glenna,
Welsh, Ervin, Lacy, and Biscotti (2011) recommend that university
administrators provide sufficient commitment to a variety of incentive
structures, funding sources, policies, and practices to allow it to invest in
a diverse set of scientific research values. Gibb et al. (2013) consider that
it is possible for university administrators to remove barriers and provide abundant
resources and support associated with the entrepreneurial paradigm as
well as carry on its existing culture, mission, and strategy. Above all,
a university administration should continuously create organizational
munificence to encourage internal actors to realign with the
mission of the university (Andrews & Johansen, 2012; Smith, Mitchell, &
Summer, 1984; Tilcsik, 2014; Wu, 2008). Therefore, this paper argues
that the senior team (i.e., university administrators) has to provide
sufficient organizational munificence to pursue research excellence
and commercialization, and the degree to which it does this will influence departments'
enhancement and simultaneous integration of KCO and KUO. Thus:

> *Hypothesis 1：The degree of organizational munificence is positively
> associated with the development of Pasteurian orientation at
> university departments.*
>
> *Hypothesis 1a：The degree of organizational munificence is positively
> associated with the sustainment of knowledge creation orientation at
> university departments.*
>
> *Hypothesis 1b：The degree of organizational munificence is positively
> associated with the development of knowledge utilization orientation
> at university departments.*

Furthermore, Clark (1998) suggests that "universities need to become
*quicker*, more adaptive and especially more focused in reactions to
expanding and changing demands." In addition, Clark (2004) argues that
"universities need to develop flexible and adaptive capabilities that
permit them to weave together new and old, change and continuity, in a
sustainable form." In line with this call, a variety of policies, such as the enhancement of
university-industry collaboration and the establishment of academic
spin-offs, has been widely instituted in universities (Perkmann et al.,
2013; Shane, 2004). Also, universities are adjusting their
infrastructure, establishing new units such as technology transfer
offices, technology liaison offices, and university-affiliated
incubators to support research commercialization (Etzkowitz, 2003;
Landry, Amara, & Rherrad, 2006). *Organizational flexibility* can be
seen as the outcome of an interaction between the responsiveness of the
organizational design and the managerial task (Volberda, 1996). Smith
and Tushman (2005) argue that organizational flexibility, as an
integrating capability, involves shifting levels of analysis identifying
potential linkages. Therefore, this study argues that these political and
infrastructure reforms provide the university department with more
organizational flexibility to promote KUO and KCO simultaneously. Thus:

> *Hypothesis 2：The degree of organizational flexibility is positively
> associated with the development of Pasteurian orientation at
> university departments.*
>
> *Hypothesis 2a：The degree of organizational flexibility is positively
> associated with the sustainment of knowledge creation orientation at
> university departments.*
>
> *Hypothesis 2b：The degree of organizational flexibility is positively
> associated with the development of knowledge utilization orientation
> at university departments.*

**2.4 Pasteurian orientation and departmental collective efficacy**

Since Stokes (1997) proposed Pasteur's quadrant and the concept of
use-inspired basic research, a new direction in science policy has been pursued, in which the
integration of knowledge creation and knowledge utilization is seen to have value, creating
both societal and scientific benefits from the one research agenda. Stokes (1997)
took as his example Louis Pasteur, who had promoted fundamental knowledge in
microbiology at the same time as he commercialized this knowledge into practice in
fermentation technology. He showed that knowledge creation and knowledge
utilization are not in conflict but complementary, even if knowledge creation 
predominates over knowledge utilization (Etzkowitz, 1983; Shibayama,
2012). In developing a Pasteurian orientation, the entrepreneurial university does not
intend to compete with or replace industry in terms of
technological development but facilitate innovation with the
advanced knowledge which stems from scientific research (Etzkowitz,
1983, 2017). At the same time, Glenna et al. (2011) also consider that the
scientific foundations and advancement of industrial technology are
likely to decline if universities do not have sufficient investment
to pursue research excellence. Therefore, this paper argues that
university departments have to sustain the commitment to knowledge
creation, and that then they may foster active development of knowledge
utilization. Thus:

> *Hypothesis 3：The knowledge creation orientation of university
> departments has a positive influence on their development of knowledge
> utilization orientation.*

However, developing a entrepreneurial university does not only create a
new organizational arrangement, or ambidextrous/hybrid organization
(Ambos et al., 2008; Etzkowitz, 2017; Guerrero & Urbano, 2012). It also
promotes self-efficacy in the new paradigm (Bouncken, 2018). As a
focal unit in the university, self-efficacy in the new paradigm in a
university department has a strong influence on faculty member peers
and on their decisions and behavior (Aschhoff & Grimpe, 2014; Jain et al., 2009) as
departmental collective efficacy (Stajkovic, Lee, & Nyberg, 2009; Watson,
Chemers, & Preiser, 2001). Collective efficacy represents
self-efficacy at the group level, and is defined as a group's shared
belief in its conjoint capabilities to organize and execute the actions
required to produce given levels of attainment (Bandura, 1997, 2000). A
high degree of collective efficacy indicates an organization has
functional organizational readiness, and has been able to internalize new
organizational practices into its routines to pursue the goals of the
organization as the organization transforms itself (Bandura, 2000;
Barrick, Thurgood, Smith, & Courtright, 2015; Holt & Vardaman, 2013).
University departments develop PO organizational propensity, 
combining knowledge creation orientation (KCO) and knowledge utilization
orientation (KUO), and this propensity represents their attempts to develop new organizational
practices by reshapement to the paradigm of the entrepreneurial
university (Leih & Teece, 2016). Moreover, departmental collective
efficacy indicates that the department's members collectively judge they now are
organized to effectively pursue research
excellence and research commercialization in the department. By means of the
development of PO, strong organizational support and faculty engagement
in both knowledge creation and knowledge commercialization can conjointly
enhance departmental collective efficacy with favorable departmental
practices in the development of the entrepreneurial university Thus:

> *Hypothesis 4： University departments with a higher propensity of PO
> are associated with a higher level of departmental collective efficacy.*
>
> *Hypothesis 4a：University departments having a knowledge creation
> orientation are associated with a higher level of departmental collective
> efficacy.*
>
> *Hypothesis 4b：University departments having a higher knowledge
> utilization orientation are associated with a higher level of
> departmental collective efficacy.*

**2.5 Mediating Effect of Pasteurian orientation**

Prior studies have argued that contextual antecedents can resolve the
internal tensions of, as well as develop the simultaneous capabilities for,
knowledge creation and knowledge utilization (Ambos et al., 2008). This
study argues that organizational munificence builds the environmental
capacity to sustain existing and new university missions, and
*organizational flexibility* creates multiple paths for these
missions, which thereby encourages cross-functional coordination and
integration between knowledge creation and knowledge utilization.
Therefore, these antecedents may enhance efficacy in an
organization which is capable of developing according to the paradigm
of the entrepreneurial university (Etzkowitz, 2003). However, Gibb et al.
(2013) argue that universities are pluralistic organizations with
different departments having very different organizational routines,
orientations, and values. So, in the absence of departmental initiative,
formal institutional contexts and flexibility may not be sufficient to
inspire a department to develop the capacity or motivation to take up
challenges in organizational adjustment required to make the transition to the
entrepreneurial university. Rasmussen, Mosey, and Wright (2014) also
think that university departments need to cultivate their ability
to develop new organizational structures, routines and support, and
to encourage and motivate their members to engage in new practices. Central to the concept
of PO is the maintaining of the multiple competencies that characterize the
ambidextrous organization (Etzkowitz, 2003; Gibson & Birkinshaw, 2004;
Tushman & O\'Reilly, 1996). Therefore, university departments have to
develop PO as the organizational capability to create
organizational practices, and then they can employ this
capability to promote departmental collective efficacy according to the new
university paradigm. Thus:

> *Hypothesis 5a： Pasteurian orientation mediates the relationship
> between organizational munificence and departmental collective
> efficacy.*
>
> *Hypothesis 5b： Pasteurian orientation mediates the relationship
> between organizational flexibility and Departmental collective
> efficacy.*
>
> This study's research framework and the corresponding
> hypotheses are depicted in Figure 3.

**3. Methods**

**3.1 The Taiwanese institutional context**

Inspired by the U.S. *Bayh-Dole Act* of 1980, Taiwan enacted the
*Science and Technology Basic Law* in 1999. Specifically, Article 6
allows universities to claim the ownership of IPRs derived from
government-funded research and removes other restrictions allowing a
more decentralized licensing policy. Consequently, Taiwanese universities
have increased their number of patent grants and licensing income, while
universities are encouraged to develop research partnerships with
industry (Chang et al., 2008).

The list of top ten universities in terms of domestic patent grants is shown in
Table 1. The primary participants in generating patent grants are public
universities, and there is also a different pattern in the patent grants
of public and private universities. Public universities have
focused on 'utility' patents, whereas private universities, including
Far East University, and Southern Taiwan University of Science and
Technology, have focused more on non-utility patents that reflect their
interests and the features of their inventions. Statistics also show a
substantial increase in paper publication, patenting, licensing, and
venture incubation between 2006 and 2010 (see Table 2).

**3.2 Questionnaire development**

A questionnaire was developed with three parts. The first part concerns
contextual antecedents, namely, organizational munificence, and organizational
flexibility, and is followed by a PO part and a departmental collective
efficacy part. The six organizational munificence items focus on the
investigation of the degree of munificence, in terms of resources, long-term
support and strategic objectives, enjoyed by the department
(Bercovitz & Feldman, 2008; Clark, 2004; Landry et al., 2006), as
perceived by the department, and the three items of
organizational flexibility were taken from Volberda (1996). The 14
PO items were adapted from Chang et al. (2009) and the three 
departmental collective efficacy items were developed referring to Riggs, Warka,
Babasa, Betancourt, and Hooker (1994). All of the
contextual antecedents, PO, and departmental collective efficacy survey items used a
7-point Likert scale.

**3.3 Sampling and Respondents**

Sampling in this study focused on university departments of
science, engineering, and medical research since they have a greater
ability to commercialize their research results. In contrast to the formal
activities (i.e., patents, licensing, or spin-offs) undertaken there,
informal activities (i.e., consultancies, training programs) are
preferred from faculty members in social science and humanities departments
(Abreu and Grinevich, 2013) and so these disciplines were excluded from the survey.

Because of the differentiation in organizational contexts and
presumed PO orientation, six universities were chosen to represent the different
forms of university, four (one medical and three comprehensive) public
universities (Universities A, B, C & D), one private comprehensive university
(University E), and one private technical university (University F).
Finally, the original survey list of the 29 schools and 172 departments
within these universities was prepared, collecting data from their websites.

Questionnaire responses were collected from administrators and faculty members who
serve in the same department to assess department-level
characteristics. In line with multilevel theory, our model consists of
"shared unit-level constructs" that we presumed to be shared within a
department (Klein & Koslowski, 2000: 41). However, to avoid the common
method variance (CMV) problem, this paper adopted the following
questionnaire design. First, the contextual antecedent questions are answered by
administrator(s) and reflect the departmental context. Second, the
Pasteurian orientation (PO) construct questions are answered by all faculty
members in each department and then aggregated to represent
department-level PO. Specifically, we compute the multiplicative
interaction between KUO and KCO to reflect the theoretical concept of
PO.

In addition, the dimensions KUO and KCO are computed through 
multiplicative interaction between o*rganizational support* and
*faculty engagement*. This composition of KUO and KCO is based on 
prior findings that the two mechanisms are non-substitutable and
interdependent. Finally, the dimension of departmental collective
efficacy is aggregated from the answers of all of the respondents in each department.

The paper built a complete survey list by referring to both university
websites and the Ministry of Science and Technology academic researcher
database. Overall, the total size of the sample in the six universities
was 2,868 faculty members. The study also compared respondents with
non-respondents, in terms of position (χ^2^= .97, p= .629), age (χ^2^=
1.00, p= .484), and tenure (χ^2^= .82, p= .945) of respondents,
indicating non-response bias was minimal. After a three-round survey
collection process, we obtained 711 returned questionnaires, an overall 26%
response rate. To meet our analysis criteria, we required that at least
one administrator and four faculty members respond to be recognized as a valid sample of the
department. Finally, there were 634 valid questionnaires, representing
27 schools and 99 departments. Table 3 provides a brief breakdown of the
respondents.

\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\--

Insert Table 3 Here

\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\--

Specifically, the respondents included 157 department administrators and
477 non-administrative faculty members. In some departments, questionnaires were answered by more than
one administrator, including by administrative
heads, chairs of departments or institutes, and directors of
administrative offices. Overall, there were 70 departments where only one
administrator answered the survey, but the average number of
administrator replies per department was 2.20. The answers of all
administrators in the same department were averaged to represent the
status of the department. In terms of gender, there were 368 male respondents (83%
of the respondents). There were 342 full professors (54%), 139 associate
professors (22%), and 133 assistant professors (21%). The length of career
of the respondents was 13.6 years on average. However, there were
393 respondents (62%) who had already received tenure as faculty
members.

**3.4 Measurements**

**3.4.1 Departmental collective efficacy**

To measure departmental collective efficacy, we collected subjective
measures for the three years (2007-2009). The survey asked the
respondents to 'assess your department/institute's capabilities and
practices pursuing research excellence/research commercialization
over the past three years compared to other equivalent departments.'
The three original items loaded on a single factor having an eigenvalue of
1.048 (α = .75) (see Appendix 1).

**3.4.2 Pasteurian orientation**

PO is a two-dimension construct comprised of KUO and KCO. It is worth
noting that all faculty members perceived their departments to have a Pasteurian orientation.
We measured knowledge creation orientation by asking faculty
members to indicate the degree to which they agreed with the corresponding statements.
Specifically, four items loaded on a single factor having an
eigenvalue of 1.568 (α = .77). We refer to this factor as
o*rganizational support for knowledge creation*. Also, three
items loaded on a single factor having an eigenvalue of 1.192 (α =.77).
We refer to this factor as *faculty engagement in knowledge
creation*. Then, we computed the multiplicative interaction between
the above knowledge creation dimensions as the k*nowledge creation
orientation* (KCO) of departments.

Similarly, we measured knowledge utilization orientation by asking
faculty members to indicate the degree to which they agree with the corresponding
statements. There were four items which loaded on a single factor having an
eigenvalue of 7.084 (α = .97). We refer to this factor as
o*rganizational* s*upport for knowledge utilization*. Also, three items
loaded on a single factor having an eigenvalue of 1.048 (α =.75). We
refer to this factor as *faculty engagement in knowledge
utilization*. We computed the multiplicative interaction between the above
knowledge utilization dimensions as *knowledge utilization orientation*
(KUO) of departments. Finally, we computed the perceived *PO* as the
multiplicative interaction between KCO and KUO (see Appendix 1).

3.  **Contextual antecedents**

The contextual antecedents part of the questionnaires had nine items that assessed
the perceptions of department administrator(s). To make the six question items related to organizational
munificence more specific, three items addressed
research excellence while the other three items addressed research
commercialization. The three items about organizational munificence and
research excellence loaded onto a single factor having an eigenvalue
of 2.02 (α = .91) (Appendix 1). The three items about organizational
munificence and research commercialization loaded onto a single
factor having an eigenvalue of 4.73 (α = .97) (Appendix 1). We
aggregated the two factors as organizational munificence, the
level of munificence for the old and new missions of the entrepreneurial
university. The other three items of organizational flexibility loaded
on a single factor with an eigenvalue of 3.035 (α =.93). Thus, we
retained this factor as our *organizational flexibility* measure (see Appendix 1).

**3.4.4 Control variables**

This study employed three control variables reflecting the
characteristics of the departments. First, ownership was measured by
whether the department belonged to a public university or not. Second, size was
represented by the number of faculty members in the department. Third, we used
a macro-variable to represent the nature of the discipline of the
department. We created three "college" variables as dummy variables
to represent whether a department belonged to an
Engineering, Science or Life Science and Medical College, respectively
(Ambos et al., 2008; D'Este & Perkmann, 2011).

**4. Results**

Table 4 reports descriptive statistics for the variables. Among
the 99 departments, the average size of the departments was 21 faculty
members. There were 53 departments (54%) from engineering colleges,
followed by 13 departments (13%) from science colleges, and 26 departments
(26%) from life science and medical colleges. PO was significantly
and positively correlated with departmental collective efficacy (β =
.560, p \< .001) as well as the two contextual antecedents,
organizational munificence (β = .260, p \< .01) and organizational
flexibility (β = .172, p \< .10).

As for the control variables, whether the department belonged to a public university was negatively
correlated to organizational munificence (β = -.200, p \< .05), KUO (β =
-.459, p \< .001) and departmental collective efficacy (β = -.241, p \<
.05). Most of the variables of interest were not significantly correlated to department
size, except for departments in life science and medicine colleges where they were
negatively correlated. The nature of the discipline had more general effects. Whether a department belonged to an engineering college or not
was positively and statistically significantly related with PO
(β = .436, *p* \< .01) and departmental collective efficacy (β = .399,
*p* \< .01). And for affiliations with science and life science and medicine colleges, the
correlations were negative (*p* \< .05).

This study tested its hypotheses using ordinary least squares (OLS)
regression. The first, H1 predicted a relationship between
organizational munificence and PO, and its sub-hypotheses H1a and
H1b similarly posited the influence of organizational munificence on the
development of KCO and KUO. As seen in Table
5, Model 2 and 5 indicate organizational munificence has a significant
positive impact on KCO (β = .251, *p* \< .05) and KUO (β = .175, *p* \<
.05) and Model 7 shows the same on PO (β = .216, *p* \< .05). H1 is fully
supported. H2 states that organizational
flexibility has a positive influence on PO. Model 3, Model 6 and
Model 8 confirm that organizational flexibility has a positive
relationship with KCO (β = .237, *p* \< .05), KUO (β = .152, *p* \< .10),
and PO (β = .184, *p* \< .10), respectively. However, H2 is only partially supported due to
the marginal impact on the development of KUO and PO.

H3 states that KCO is positively associated with departmental KUO. As
shown in Table 6, Model 9 confirms there is a strong relationship between the two components of PO.
(β = .605, *p* \< .001). Furthermore, H4 predicted that the development
of PO would contribute to departmental collective efficacy. To
observe the effects of KCO and KUO, we sub-divided the H4 hypothesis
into H4a and H4b. Model 10, Model 11, and Model 12
confirm that university departments developing KCO (β = .381, *p* \<
.001), KUO (β = .459, *p* \< .001), and PO (β = .459, *p* \< .001) 
positively enhance their collective efficacy. In other words, H4 is
fully supported. Finally, H5 predicted there would be a mediating
effect of PO on the relationship between contextual antecedents and departmental
collective efficacy. Following Baron and Kenny (1986), we examined
separately this hypothesis for munificence and flexibility as H5a and H5b. Through the results
of Model 13 and Model 14, we see PO partially mediated the
relationship between organizational munificence (β = .177, *p* \< .05)
and departmental collective efficacy (β = .414, *p* \< .001). And in
Model 15 and Model 16, it is shown PO fully mediated the relationship between 
organizational flexibility (β = .081) and departmental collective
efficacy (β = .442, *p* \< .001) . H5a and H5b are supported, but it is
worthy to note that the balance exerted by organizational munificence on
pursuing research excellence and research commercialization has 
partial influence on departmental collective efficacy (Aldwin, 1994;
Baron & Kenny, 1986).

**5. Discussion**

By positioning the academic transition on organizational development for
the rise of entrepreneurial universities, this paper aimed to understand
an ambidextrous development in university departments (Etzkowitz, 2017).
The study proposed an organizational propensity, 'Pasteurian
orientation,' and examined its development and relationships between
university antecedents and departmental collective efficacy. First, the
findings suggest that the university munificence and flexibility are
critical determinants for facilitating the development of Pasteurian
orientation within departments. This study argues that organizational
munificence provides necessary legitimacy and support for the
subordinated departments to redefine their organizational practices
towards Pasteurian orientation (Powers & McDougall, 2005; Vanaelst et
al., 2006). Through a significant effect on knowledge creation and
knowledge utilization, this evidence confirms organizational munificence
has a secure connection with the engagement of university departments,
even has a direct effect on departmental collective efficacy
(Owen-smith, 2005; Perkmann et al., 2013). Furthermore, the result is
aligned with other organizational contexts that can facilitate or
transit to ambidextrous structures or Pasteurian orientation in
universities (Gibson & Birkinshaw, 2004), including shared vision,
common culture (O'Reilly & Tushman, 2008)and social integration (Jansen,
Tempelaar, van den Bosch, & Volberda, 2009) between the existing (e.g.
teaching and research) and the new missions (commercialization and
entrepreneurship). Moreover, there is significant evidence in line with
Clark\'s (2004)'s survey of the leading entrepreneurial universities,
which suggested that a more flexible and adaptable organization can
respond to environmental changes and encourage the development of
'entrepreneurial' universities. Jansen et al. (2009) also suggested that
cross-functional interfaces create a formal integration mechanism that
can respond to environmental changes. Furthermore, the result is
consistent with the arguments of past research that universities and
managers are more flexible and less bureaucratic, and create a
munificent environment for facilitating their organizational
ambidexterity or Pasteurian orientation (Andrews & Johansen, 2012;
Friedman & Silberman, 2003; Siegel, Waldman, & Link, 2003; Tilcsik,
2014; Tushman & O\'Reilly, 1996).

Second, this paper finds that knowledge creation orientation is
predominant in developing knowledge utilization orientation, and the two
orientations can be reconciled via the development of the PO. This
empirical finding is consistent with the argument that research
excellence and research commercialization are more complementary, rather
than contradictory, within entrepreneurial universities (Guerrero,
Urbano, Fayolle, Klofsten, & Mian, 2016; Sengupta & Ray, 2017).
University departments are suggested to sustain excellent research works
firstly, and they should create a hybrid context that allows the balance
of KUO and KCO. Specifically, university departments employ the PO to
create organizational norms, routines, and recognition for leading
faculty members engaging in the new university paradigm. (Ambos et al.,
2008; Bercovitz & Feldman, 2008; Chang et al., 2016). Our results
confirm that the PO has a robust association with departmental
collective efficacy.

Third, the PO acts as a mediator between contextual antecedents and
departmental collective efficacy. Etzkowitz (2003) considers that the
universities provide equivalent institutional spheres on pursuing
research excellence and research commercialization could function
effectively to coordinate the emergence of conflict of interests in
developing the new paradigm of entrepreneurial universities. Moreover,
the development of overlapping institutional spheres that encourages the
development of hybrid entities which they can reconcile seemingly
contradictory ideas and practices (Schildt & Perkmann, 2017; Tuunainen,
2005). In our findings, university departments with a high degree of PO
mean that they could harbor the "opposing" norms and orientations, and
they have the capabilities to reinterprets the legitimation of harmony
and mutual reinforcement from each goal. In other words, the
universities provide sufficient organizational munificence and shape a
flexible environment that could facilitate the departments to engage in
multiple missions. They need to develop the PO to coordinate knowledge
creation and knowledge utilization in the new paradigm of
entrepreneurial universities for better departmental collective
efficacy.

**6. Conclusion**

In the previous studies, it has indicated university departments are
essential and focal units which shape, lead, and demonstrate to the
behaviors of faculty members which is reflected on organizational
identity, norms, learning, and peer reference (Aschhoff & Grimpe, 2014;
Jain et al., 2009; Perkmann et al., 2013). Unlike previous studies
focusing on the analysis of institutional (i.e., the passage of
*Bayh-Dole Act*) or individual (i.e., faculty members) aspects, this
paper used organizational meso-level, university departments as the unit
of analysis and suggested their interplay of organizational layers in
stimulating the development of entrepreneurial universities.

This paper finds that organizational munificence and organizational
flexibility are critical organizational antecedents. The level of
organizational munificence would influence the university departments to
engage in the new paradigm, and equivalent support to differentiated
activities of the university's missions could keep a balancing act.
Moreover, a high degree of organizational flexibility could help
university departments quickly adopt new practices with no adverse
influence on existing ones, and it provide agility to align with the new
paradigm of entrepreneurial universities.

Moreover, the findings also indicated that the PO is a valuable
strategic perspective for departmental collective efficacy. The PO acts
as a mediator between contextual antecedents and departmental collective
efficacy, suggesting that the university contextual factors act only as
a *necessary condition* to promote departments engaging in the new
paradigm of universities. However, the development of the PO is a
*sufficient condition*. The paper concludes the concept of PO as highly
promising for reconciling the conflicts and balance between knowledge
creation and knowledge utilization in entrepreneurial universities.
Encouraging organizational contexts with a high level of organizational
munificence and flexibility that generates dual capabilities for
knowledge creation and knowledge utilization may be a critical source of
competitive advantage for creating entrepreneurial universities.

This paper advanced our understanding of organizational strategies and
structures to develop PO at university departments. First, this paper
integrates the Pasteur's quadrant framework and ambidexterity theory
into a strategic and organizational ability of PO. It also extends the
application of Pasteur's quadrant framework at the organization level.
Second, via the developed construct and measurement of PO, university
departments could compose, diagnose, and measure their PO. Third, this
paper confirms the organizational meso-mediation relation between
contextual factors, PO, and departmental collective efficacy.

Some policy and managerial implications are suggested as follows. The
nature of universities is characterized to be bureaucratic organizations
that stress the institutionalization (Clark, 1998), and the resource
endowments would determine the paths to organizational development
(Siegel & Wright, 2015). However, the universities also have high
autonomy and self-organizing system (Martin, 2012). For building the
paradigm of entrepreneurial universities, university administrators
should create a munificent environment and provide a high degree of
flexibility to encourage departments to reshape organizational
practices. Moreover, to maintain strategic and structural balances
between old and new missions, and knowledge creation and knowledge
utilization tasks are never easy. It is necessary to develop the right
degree of integration and coordination among the administrative team,
colleges, and departments in order to maintain the right balance and a
coherent action plan. For developing the PO at departments, departmental
heads may use the proposed construct and measurement to diagnose or
build up their departments' norms, routines, support, and engagement
towards PO.
