The Business Model and Innovation Mix in Transition: Evidence from Taiwanese
Contract Manufacturers

The successful transition of Taiwanese contract manufacturers from followers to leaders is a
critical case for the study of business model innovation by latecomers in
an emerging Asia. From original equipment manufacturers (OEM) to original
brand manufacturers (OBM), latecomers engage in different innovation
practices to coordinate with the transition of their value propositions in
different manufacturing business models. Using data from the second and
third Taiwanese industrial innovation surveys, we attempt to depict the
innovation practices followed in different business models as well as the
changes in the transition from one model to another. The results indicate that OEM latecomers have
lower engagement in all kinds of innovation practices, while original
design manufacturers (ODM) and OBM ones actively engage in
technological, marketing, and organizational innovation, according to
their value propositions in the market. In the retooling of their business
model, OEM latecomers make more organizational changes as
preparation for radical changes in all their innovation practices,
as new ODM entrants face stiff challenges in enhancing
product innovation and market promotion. Furthermore, new OBM entrants
are forced to pay more attention to organizational adjustment and the expansion of
marketing practices. The paper concludes that business model
innovation comprises a mix of innovation in the production and
organizational work required to express a value proposition, and business
model transition is a consequence of firms making the effort to adjust the
innovation mix to realize a new value proposition. Some managerial
implications are suggested.

Introduction
============

In recent times, the transformation undergone by contract manufacturers has become a
critical issue in emerging countries. With the increase of their experience in
contracted manufacturing, these manufacturers accumulated sufficient
technological capabilities to undertake in-house R&D and play catch-up with their
customers in the market. This experience also has stimulated firms to advance both
upstream and downstream in the value chain pursuing firm growth.
The OEM-ODM-OBM transition has become a well-traveled pathway for contract
manufacturers seeking to improve their business models, and the many success
stories from Taiwan (Chu 2009; Kuo and Minshall 2010; Hobday 1998),
Korea (Lee, Song, and Kwak 2015; Hobday 1998), and China (Wan 2015; Zhu,
Zhang, and Lin 2017) have established role models for companies seeking to copy their success.
However, contract manufacturers face substantial
challenges not only in competence building and leveraging but also
value proposition reinventing in the existing market when they change
their business models (Johnson, Christensen, and Kagermann 2008; Teece
2010; Amit and Zott 2012).

In the manufacturing sector, vertical specialization has increasingly
dominated world trade, encouraging firms to take specific roles in
the value chains of the global production network (Hummels, Ishii, and
Yi 2001; Hummels, Rapoport, and Yi 1998). Vertical
specialization gives contract manufacturers in
late-coming countries the opportunity to develop a specific business model and participate
in competition in the existing market (Jacobides, MacDuffie, and Tae
2016). Through the value propositions of their business models, contract
manufacturers develop their business activities and create added value
on the production network by means of R&D, manufacturing, and marketing work
(Feng-Hsu, Heng-Yih, and Ting-Ling 2008; Jacobides, MacDuffie, and Tae
2016). To sustain an advantage in the production network, contract
manufacturers rely upon continuing to create sufficient added value in the
existing market through the engagement of the different innovation practices
of their business model, including product innovation, process
innovation, and marketing innovation (Kuo and Minshall 2010; Chu 2009;
Hobday 1998; Matthyssens, Vandenbempt, and Weyns 2009). Furthermore,
contract manufacturers also need to engage in active organizational
management as part of their business model in order to coordinate internal business
activities as well as establish external relationships with their customers,
vendors, and suppliers (Carayannis, Sindakis, and Walter 2015; Wang and
Chen 2020; Zott and Amit 2010).

In the course of growth in contract manufacturing, contract manufacturers develop a
strong desire to upgrade their businesses and catch more market value
from the existing market (Hobday 1998). But with the repositioning of their value
propositions in the production network, contract manufacturers have to
reconfigure their innovation practices when they are making changes to their
business models (Matthyssens, Vandenbempt, and Weyns 2009; Kuo and
Minshall 2010; Wang and Wu 2012). Therefore, understanding the
different configurations of innovation practices in the OEM,
ODM, and OBM business models could provide practical guidance to contract manufacturers seeking reinvention
of their models. Furthermore, examining
the reconfiguration of innovation practices in the transitions between models also could
constitute instructions to new entrants on catching up in the new business
model.

This study focuses on the Taiwanese manufacturing sector as its subject
since Taiwan, as a latecomer, is typical in the way the business of
contracted manufacturing has changed there. Many Taiwanese manufacturers have
developed well-run OEM, ODM, and OBM business models and many have
transitioned through one or more of these business models (Chu 2009; Kuo and Minshall 2010; Hobday
1998). Using a large-scale survey of the Taiwan manufacturing
sector, we provide detailed observations of the innovation practices
followed under the OEM, ODM, OBM models there. Furthermore, we also examine the
reconfiguration of innovation practices in the transition from one model to another. In the next
section, this paper will discuss business model innovation
in the manufacturing sector and the mix of innovation practices in
 OEM, ODM, and OBM models. In the methodology section, we will provide more
information on data collection, variable compilation, and analytical
method. In the results section, the paper will show a comprehensive Taiwanese
case in business model transition for contract manufacturers. In the
final section, we will discuss the findings in light of the results of prior studies, seek to provide
an insightful conclusion and develop the implications for research and business
practices.

Business model innovation in manufacturing sectors: Contract Manufacturing in OEM, ODM, OBM
===========================================================================================

With the vertical specialization of global production networks, the
business of contract manufacturing has become a new opportunity for
latecomers in the existing market (Hummels, Ishii, and Yi 2001; Hummels,
Rapoport, and Yi 1998). This new business opportunity triggers business
model innovation in the manufacturing sector, in which the work of the
value chains cuts into the specific but interconnected business models of the
firms involved (Matthyssens, Vandenbempt, and Weyns 2009; Hobday 1998). A
business model describes the way firms do business, and
consists of value propositions, business activities, and organizational
management (Amit and Zott 2012; Zott and Amit 2010). Contract
manufacturing encourages and re-assigns the new business models followed in
manufacturing production work into the original equipment manufacturing
(OEM), the original design manufacturing (ODM), and the own-brand
manufacturing (OBM) types. OEM firms are those where latecomers produce
finished goods to precise specifications under subcontract with
designers or brand companies (Chin, Liu, and Yang 2016; Hobday 1998).
ODM firms are ones where latecomers develop or co-develop for
outsourcers and provide finished goods which the brand outsourcers
sell (Hobday 1998; Bijarboneh 2015). An OBM firm is a latecomer that
designs, produces, and sell its finished goods under its own-brand name as
a new entrant in the existing market (Luo 2011; Kuo and Minshall 2010).
These business models have defined the general operation of latecomers
as specialized manufacturers in the production networks of value
chains.

As for value proposition for their customers, OEM latecomers posit their
value on providing the contracted manufacturing with advantages in
cost, speed, and reliability (Chin, Liu, and Yang 2016; Jacobides,
MacDuffie, and Tae 2016). ODM latecomers provide customized product
development and contract manufacturing, along with the coordination of
marketing strategy to brand subcontractors (Bijarboneh 2015; Lee, Song,
and Kwak 2015). OBM latecomers sell innovative products to promote the
utilization scenarios of customers (Chu 2009; Feng-Hsu, Heng-Yih, and Ting-Ling
2008). As for business activities, latecomers configure their work
through the position of their production work on their value chains, including
by means of R&D, manufacturing and marketing (Chu 2009; Manzakoğlu and Er 2018).
In addition, to sustain a competitive advantage in their business,
latecomers will engage in different forms of value creation in their
production work. In R&D work, the engagement of product innovation
enhances the ability of latecomers to introduce a new product into the market
(Huang, Chung, and Lin 2009; Wang and Wu 2012). In manufacturing work,
latecomers invest in process innovation to support the production of
new products (Snihur and Wiklund 2019). In marketing work, latecomers
promote sales in the market through innovative marketing strategies (Eng
and Spickett-Jones 2009; Matthyssens, Vandenbempt, and Weyns 2009). For
OEM latecomers, the focus is on manufacturing work to meet the
cost, speed, and reliability requests of outsourcers, which they can expect to become greater in
a stable and incremental manner (Chin, Liu, and Yang 2016;
Bijarboneh 2015). In other words, innovation in the process of
manufacturing will be at the core of the business activities of OEM firms
(Forbes and Wield 2008; Hobday, Rush, and Bessant 2004). For ODM
latecomers, their main focus is on R&D and manufacturing to provide
contract designing and manufacturing work for brand outsourcers. The
interconnection of product innovation and process innovation promotes
the technological capabilities of ODM firms to help their customers
provide innovative products in the market (Tiong et al. 2010; Wang and
Wu 2012; Hobday, Rush, and Bessant 2004). For OBM latecomers, new
entrants in an existing market, they do not want only to expand their
marketing innovation efforts to compete with incumbent firms. They also seek to
strengthen product innovation and process innovation and thus gain an
advantage for their products in technological development and manufacturing
(Eng 2009; Chu 2009).

Whatever the business model of a firm, organizational management plays a
coordination role, moderating the firm's business activities and its
performance (Wang and Chen 2020; Carayannis, Sindakis, and Walter 2015;
Teece 2010). Internally, the lines of managerial authority and
organizational structures determine organizational efficiency and
the reaction to changes in business activities (Taran, Boer, and
Lindgren 2015; Teece 2010). Externally, partnerships in contract
manufacturing have dominated the interconnections of latecomers with specific suppliers
in the value chain to create aggregate value and promote the
customer's value in the market (Eng and Spickett-Jones 2009; Sánchez and
Ricart 2010). Internally, in organizational management, latecomers
will follow their core business as determining the rules of organizational
management. OEM latecomers will adapt their structures to accommodate
manufacturing processes, and promote the efficiency of
production (Chen 2016). ODM latecomers will combine product and
manufacturing lines in organizational management to enhance their contract
product development (Ma 2005; Yung and Lai 2012). OBM latecomers will
restructure to promote product-market organizational management, as this is
beneficial to responding to the needs of the customers quickly (Eng and
Spickett-Jones 2009; Eng 2009). Externally, in the aspect of organizational
management, partnerships in outsourcing contracts are at the core of
external relationship management in contract manufacturing. OEM
latecomers need a stable and long-term relationship with suppliers
of their components to support their manufacturing activities (Jacobides, MacDuffie,
and Tae 2016; Szalkai and Magyar 2017). ODM latecomers may need to
manage the relationships with module partners, OEM partners, and
suppliers, and adjust the outsourcing according to the demands of contract product
development (Yung and Lai 2012). OBM latecomers will undergo transformation of their roles
from subcontractor to outsourcer, strategically outsourcing
their production work to external partners (Chin, Liu, and Yang 2016; Chu
2009).

As can be seen from the summary of business models in contract manufacturing in
Table 1, the three models of contract manufacturers demonstrate
differences in the configuration required to do business in existing markets. At the same time, when
latecomers want to upgrade their business models, they face many
common challenges in the transition that are the same as those that most
incumbent firms encounter. Chesbrough (2010) considers that
incumbent firms may encounter a tension between the configuration of
their existing business model and the reconfiguration required by the new business
model. Teece (2010) argues that incumbent firms have to recognize
business activities in their value chains and to implement innovation
practices in their business activities to create a new competitive advantage in
the existing market when they re-design their business models. Koen,
Bertels, and Elsum (2011) think that incumbent firms have to organize a
new value network to interconnect the value creation of their internal
business activities and the work of their upstream and downstream
partners when they seek a new business model in an existing market to pursue
growth. Euchner and Ganguly (2014) mention that incumbent firms should
redefine their value proposition to guide them in the shift of business
activities for the purpose of new value creation. Carayannis, Sindakis, and Walter
(2015) indicate that incumbent firms should cultivate an active internal
organizational management that they incorporate in business activities in order to
sustain innovation practices in the market. Furthermore, dynamic
governance of external partnerships will enrich the firm\'s ability
to make the most of new business opportunities during transitions to a
different business model. Above all, if a contract manufacturer wants to
upgrade its business model, it needs a clear understanding of the patterns of the model as
it reconfigures its business activities following the repositioning of its
value proposition. Also, competence building and leveraging through the
reconfiguration of innovation practices will enhance its organizational
sustainability in the market as it comes up to speed in the new business model and
competes with other incumbent competitors.

Empirical examination in Taiwanese Manufacturing Sectors
========================================================

Manufacturing sectors in Taiwan
-------------------------------

To establish a context for the paper's investigation of contract manufacturing in Taiwan, we 
summarize data in Table 2 about the manufacturing sector from
the Industry and Service Census in Taiwan, a survey by the Taiwanese government carried out every five years
(DGBAS 2008, 2013, 2019). From 2006 to 2016, the size of the Taiwanese
manufacturing sector increased significantly, the number of firms rising from 147,908 to 161,334. OBM
model representatives had substantial growth from 8,878 firms in 2006 to 13,797 firms in
2011, indicating the five-year period was a critical one with many
firms making the transition to the OBM model. As for production by the
sector, total sales of goods also saw steady
growth from 18,412 NT billion in 2006 to 25,175 NT billion in 2011. 
Almost 24% of total sales was from new products. Sales by
OBM businesses took a more than
22% share of total sales, even though they represented less than 10% of the total number of firms,
indicating their revenue was probably more than non-OBM firms. Furthermore,
offshore sales of OBM firms increased from 2,076 NT billion
in 2006 to 3,580 NT billion in 2011, indicating that OBM firms in
Taiwan enjoyed a steady growth in foreign markets.

Data collection
---------------

The aim of this study is to investigate the configuration of
innovation practices in firms following the OEM, ODM, OBM models as well as examine
reconfiguration of those practices by contract manufacturers undertaking business model
transitions. We employ the Taiwanese
Industrial Innovation Survey (TIS), a large-scale survey of the industries of Taiwan
conducted by the Ministry of Science and Technology, which is similar to the Community Innovation
Survey (CIS) in Europe. Collecting data, we collated responses
in the second survey in 2004-2006 (TIS2) and the third survey in
2007-2010 (TIS3) (Wu 2009, 2013). After removing responses from
non-manufacturing firms, there remained 3,944 valid questionnaires in TIS2
and 3,838 in TIS3. Moreover, 1,319 manufacturing firms were listed
in both the TIS2 and TIS3 surveys. Furthermore, we identified the
business models of the firms. There were 427 OEM firms, 543 ODM
firms, and 562 OBM firms in TIS2. There were 699 OEM firms, 816 ODM firms,
and 1,223 OBM firms in TIS3.

Variables compilation
---------------------

In the compilation of variables, values are assigned to variables separately in TIS2 and
TIS3. All variables in the study are nominal or dummy variables. For
engagement in innovation (innovation practices), we compile *Product Innovation*
and *Process Innovation* variables, measures of whether a firm engaged in new
product development and in reworking of the manufacturing process. To measure
marketing innovation, we assigned to *Product Design*, *Channel
Distribution*, and *Marketing Promotion* variables, depending on whether a firm
engaged in changes to its marketing strategies for product design,
for marketing channels, and for promotion in the market selling its products
to its customers. For organizational innovation, we compile two
variables to measure internal changes in a firm, *Authority Realignment*
and *Organization Restructuring*, assessing the extent to which revision of
managerial authority and organizational structure of the firm took place. In addition,
we also compile a variable, *Outsourcing Re-assignment*, which examines
changes in a firm's external outsourcing relationship with
its suppliers and customers.

For the business model of a contract manufacturer, we assign a sole
value to the firm in the *OEM*, *ODM*, and *OBM* variables. As for transition from
one business model to another, we only gather data from the 1,319 firms which were
both listed in TIS2 and TIS3. For the upgrade of an OEM firm, we compile
*OEM transition* in TIS2, with 1 meaning that the business model of the firm
is OEM in TIS2, but non-OEM in TIS3 and 0 indicating that the firm
stays at OEM in both TIS2 and TIS3, and we skip all non-OEM firms. Following the same
logic, we compile an *ODM transition* in TIS2 as the upgrade of an ODM
firm. Concomintant with the upgrading of the business model, we set up *ODM Entrant* in
TIS3, with 1 meaning that the business model of the firm is ODM in TIS3,
but OEM in TIS2 and 0 representing other ODM firms in TIS3, and we skip
all non-ODM firms. Similarly, we compile an *OBM Entrant* variable in TIS3 for the
upgraded OEM and ODM firms.

As supporting variables, we measure characteristics of a firm that may be
factors in the employment of innovation practices. The industrial
characteristic of *Hitech* represents the high-tech affiliation of a
firm with a two-digit code of 
20, 26, and 27, with 1 meaning the firm is a high-tech firm. The size of
a firm is represented by *SME*, with 1 meaning that the firm has more than
200 people. The geography of the market of a firm is coded with
*Domestic*, where 1 means that the firm has no sales in other
countries. The primary client of the firm is compiled with *B2C*,
with 1 meaning that the primary client of the firm is the end-user.

Analytical model
----------------

There are two critical investigations in this paper. Firstly, we want to
investigate the configuration of innovation practices under the OEM,
ODM, and OBM models. We have two datasets, TIS2 and TIS3 that could be
employed to do this. To choose which one to analyze, We use the independent sample test to examine the
differences in innovation practices between TIS2 and TIS3. The results
indicate that TIS2 and TIS3 are two independent samples in product
innovation (t=4.381, p\<0.001), process innovation (t=-3.025, p\<0.01),
product design (t=-.248), channel distribution (t=5.199, p\<0.001),
marketing promotion (t=.415), authority realignment (t=-9.707,
p\<0.001), organization restructuring (t=-7.825, p\<0.001), and
outsourcing re-assignment (t=-6.113, p\<0.001). Therefore, as our interest is in
the business development of contract manufacturing in Taiwan, we
decide to employ the data of TIS3 as the observation. Then, we use
logistic regression to investigate the configuration of innovation
practices of the firms under the models of OEM, ODM, and OBM.

Secondly, we want to examine the reconfiguration that takes place in business model
upgrading. To observe the changes in the transition, we take the
1,319 firms which were both listed in TIS2 and TI3. To examine the changes
before the transition, we cut the TIS2 data into two sub-datasets of just OEM
firms and ODM firms. We employ the models of logistic regression and
take OEM transition and ODM transition as the independent variables
which may influence the innovation practices of the firms. Following the
same logic in the examination in the changes after the transition, we
cut the TIS3 data into two sub-datasets of just ODM firms and OBM firms and
employ logistic regression to analyze the effects of ODM entrant and OBM
entrant as the independent variables. For post hoc analysis, we employ
ANOVA to validate the results.

Descriptive statistics
----------------------

A feature of the general structure of the manufacturing sector in Taiwan, high-tech
firms represent one-fifth to one-fourth of the total number of firms during the 2003-2011 period, and
SME dominates in size of firms with 89% in TIS2 and 74% in TIS3.
The decrease in the share of sales held by the domestic market from 48%
in TIS2 to 31% in TIS3 indicates that the export of manufacturing goods
continues to acquire greater significance for the sector. Low rates for B2C
(25% in TIS2 and 21% in TIS3) show that most manufacturers
sell their products to other business customers. As for the development of
contract manufacturing evidenced in the two surveys, the combined share of OEM
and ODM firms of 25% in TIS2 and 42% in TIS3 indicate contract
manufacturing is the general business model and is increasing in
the manufacturing sector in Taiwan. The growth in the number of OBM firms over the 2006-2010
period from 14% in TIS2 to 34% in TIS3 is consistent with the statistics from the
Industry and Service Census in Taiwan.

The configuration of innovation practices in OEM, ODM, and OEM Models
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Results for the innovation practices in the manufacturing sector for nominal variable means for product innovation
(0.25 in TIS2 and 0.21 in TIS3) and process innovation (0.22 in TIS2 and
0.25 in TIS3) show more manufacturers have yet to engage in innovative practices. In marketing
innovation, product design (0.16 in TIS2 and TIS3) was a significant
activity associated with the market for manufacturing firms. In
organizational innovation for business development, the frequency of
internal changes was greater than that for the adjustment of external partnerships.
The engagement in organizational changes increased during
the 2006-2010 period, with an increase of Authority Realignment from 0.18 in
TIS2 to 0.27 in TIS3, a rise of Organization Restructuring from 0.18
in TIS2 to 0.25 in TIS3, and an increase of Outsourcing Re-assignment
from 0.12 in TIS2 to 0.16 in TIS3. In business model transitions by contract
manufacturers, OEM firms (17% of the OEM firms of TIS2) seem to have had more
motivation to upgrade their OEM business model than ODM firms (5% of the
ODM firms of TIS2) had to upgrade theirs. At the same time, not all OEM firms will have upgraded their
business models to OBM, seeing that only 4% of the OBM firms of TIS3 were upgrading. ODM is the first-choice transition of OEM firms, with 5% of the ODM firms
of TIS3 having been OEM firms. This
suggests that time as an ODM on the OEM-ODM-OBM path may be an essential step in the
upgrading of the business model of contracted manufacturers.

To investigate the effect of innovation-practice configuration
in contract manufacturing, this study adopted the three specific models
of OEM, ODM, and OBM, and employed
logistic regression to examine the influence of these business models on
the practices of the firms surveyed (Table 4). For OEM contracted
manufacturers, no significant engagement in product
innovation (β=-.233), process innovation (β=-.049), and marketing
innovation (*Product Design*, β=.322; *Channel Distribution*, β=.099;
*Marketing Promotion*, β=-.128, p\<0.001) is indicated. On the changes in
organizational management, OEM firms may have a significant engagement
in corporate restructuring (β=.318, p\<0.05). A post-hoc
ANOVA analysis (Table 5) also confirms that OEM firms have low
engagement in all innovation practices in their business activities. Meanwhile,
ODM contract manufacturers aggressively engage in product
innovation (β=.351, p\<0.01) and process innovation (β=.553, p\<0.001)
and also have significant engagement in marketing innovation (*Product
Design*, β=1.030, p\<0.001; *Channel Distribution*, β=.693, p\<0.001;
*Marketing Promotion*, β=.829, p\<0.001). Facing a high degree of
engagement in innovation practices in production work, ODM firms
show significant change in organizational management in the areas of managerial
authority (β=.219, p\<0.10), organizational structure (β=.649,
p\<0.001), and outsourcing partnership (β=.819, p\<0.001).

OBM manufacturers also have significant positive engagement in
innovation practices in all aspects of production work, including product innovation
(β=.447, p\<0.001), process innovation (β=.249, p\<0.05), and marketing
innovation (*Product Design*, β=1.423, p\<0.001; *Channel Distribution*,
β=.771, p\<0.001; *Marketing Promotion*, β=1.430, p\<0.001). Moreover,
at high frequency they make adjustments to their organizational management in
the areas of managerial authority (β=.699, p\<0.001), organizational structure
(β=.291, p\<0.01), and management of outsourcing partnerships (β=.708,
p\<0.001).

The ANOVA test of the relationship of innovation practices to business models in Table 5
also confirms that ODM and OBM firms have significant engagement in all
innovation practices. However, there still are differences in the
configuration of innovation practices followed by ODM and OBM manufacturers.
On the one hand, ODM firms have more engagement in process innovation
and organization restructuring, but with equivalent involvement in
product innovation, marketing channels, and outsourcing management.
On the other hand, OBM firms have more engagement in marketing strategies, and
they make aggressive adjustments to managerial authority to support
their business activities.

practices for OEM, ODM, and OBM firms.

The reconfiguration of innovation practices before the upgrade of the business model in contract manufacturers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As we know, an upgrade in the model of a contract manufacturer will redefine its
way of doing business. As a result, it will face the task of reconfiguring many different aspects of its organization
and its business activities. When a
firm has a plan to reinvent its business model, it needs good
preparation ahead of the transition to ensure the move is successful. Therefore,
this next section examines to what degree firms are reworking their innovation practices before
upgrading. First,
we consider the differences in the practices of 
preparing-to-upgrade and status-quo OEM firms. In Table 6, the results indicate
that there are no significant changes to their innovation practices in
production work before upgrades by OEM firms in product innovation
(β=-.120), process innovation(β=.445), and marketing innovation
(*Product Design*, β=.020; *Channel Distribution*, β=.251; *Marketing
Promotion*, β=-.272), the same as the results of the ANOVA test in Table 7.
Although only a significant engagement in the change of
managerial authority (β=.893, p\<0.01) is indicated in Table 6, the ANOVA test in Table 7 finds OEM firms
are more able to change all aspects of their organizational management
(*Authority Realignment*, F=10.208, p\<0.01; *Organization
Restructuring*, F=0.524, p\<0.05; *Outsourcing Re-assignment*, F=5.581,
p\<0.05) before they upgrade.

transition.

Second, we consider the differences in the configuration of ODM firms before
upgrading. Table 8 shows that ODM firms have many
non-significant differences in the reconfiguration of innovation before
an upgrade, including in *Product Innovation* (β=.213),
*Product Design* (β=-.157), *Marketing Promotion* (β=-.137), *Authority
Realignment* (β=.583), *Organization Restructuring* (β=-.038), and
*Outsourcing Re-assignment* (β=-.767). However, other results from the same table indicate
that ODM firms reduce engagement in process innovation (β=-.918,
p\<0.05) and the exploration of marketing channels (β=-1.070,
p\<0.10). Furthermore, the ANOVA test in Table 7 confirms
these findings, and it also finds a visible increase in *Authority Realignment*
(μ=.556\>.388) and decreases in *Outsourcing Re-assignment*
(μ=.185\<.290).

The reconfiguration of innovation practices after the upgrade of the business model in contract manufacturers
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After transition to the next business model, the new entrant will make
efforts to build new business activities and reconfigure its
production work in its value chains to compete with incumbent firms
in the market. Examining the differences in the innovation practices of
new entrant and of incumbent firms provides an opportunity to understand what apparent efforts new
entrants are making to catch up with established practices of the new business model as well as
cope with new challenges. However, we see new entrants into the ODM
business ranks may have significantly insufficient engagement in
product innovation (β=-.856, p\<0.10) and marketing promotion (β=-1.890,
p\<0.10), in comparison with incumbent firms (Table 9).

Also, we tabulate the means of engagement in innovation practices in
Table 7, and we find new ODM entrants have distinctly low levels of activity in
average on *Product Innovation* (μ=.163\<.265), Product *Design*
(μ=.130\<.239), *Channel Distribution* (μ=.109\<.162), and *Marketing
Promotion* (μ=.022\<.126) in comparison with incumbents. Clearly, OEM contract manufacturers
face challenges building new competencies in R&D and
marketing work when they transit to the ODM
model.

New OBM business entrants exhibit a comprehensive
enhancement of production work in the market (Table 10), including in
product innovation (β=.728, p\<0.05), process innovation (β=.277), and
marketing innovation (*Product Design*, β=.631, p\<0.05; *Channel
Distribution*, β=.504; *Marketing Promotion*, β=.893, p\<0.05).
Moreover, they usually rework organizational management internally
(*Authority Realignment*, β=.650, p\<0.05; Organization *Restructuring*,
β=.647, p\<0.05) and externally (*Outsourcing Re-assignment*, β=.599,
p\<0.10). These observations are borne out by the ANOVA results in Table 7, where the engagement means show that the new
OBM entrants are making greater efforts to establish the new practices of their
new businesses for competition in the market.

Discussions
===========

In the empirical examination, this paper employs the investigation of
Taiwanese contract manufacturers for reconfiguring their business
activities in the transition of business models. Through reviewing the
business model innovation in contract manufacturing, OEM, ODM, and OBM
firms demonstrate differentiated business activities to implement a
value proposition in the existing market by providing valued production
works. For detail, the engagement of innovation practices behind the
business models explains the value creation and organizational
configuration in contract manufacturers to promote their competitive
advantage in the market.

As an entry mode of contract manufacturing, we find that OEM firms have
lower engagement in the innovation of production works as well as fewer
changes in organizational management. In the OEM model, to sustain
excellent manufacturing efficiency is the core business of the firms,
and to avoid the changes to keep cost advantage in the market becomes
the critical factor to firm performance. Wang and Wu (2012) examined the
moderation of the contract manufacturing model on the relationship
between R&D investment and the operating performance, and it found a
negative effect on the OEM model, in which R&D investment may reduce the
performance of OEM firms. Feng-Hsu, Heng-Yih, and Ting-Ling (2008)
considered that OEM contract manufacturers leverage existing
manufacturing competence, which involves a low level of risk. Moreover,
the success of the OEM model depends on the effectiveness of current
organizational practices to offer incremental improvements on sustaining
to fulfill customers' needs (Kittilaksanawong 2015).

On the configuration of innovation practices to ODM firms, product
innovation, process innovation, marketing product design, and
organizational changes have significantly positive engagement in the run
of business. For ODM model, contract manufacturers extend its value
works to upstream outsourcing in new product development, product
innovation, and process innovation synergize as technological
capabilities of the ODM firms to demonstrate the primary product design
process in the market (Lee, Song, and Kwak 2015; Wang and Wu 2012).
Furthermore, the ODM model connects the value works to downstream
marketing practices to demonstrate the abilities of latecomers to react
to the changes in the needs of end-users as the selling of market
flexibility to the customers (Chu 2009; Manzakoğlu and Er 2018). Also,
organizational management in ODM firms needs to be adaptive in dynamic
markets to renew the internal organizational practices for the changes
quickly and to reassign the external partnership for fostering new
product development and manufacturing (Yung and Lai 2012; Christensen,
Bartman, and Van Bever 2016). In contrast to OEM firms, ODM contract
manufacturers have to upgrade their business activities to catch more
production works in the value chains, and engagement in the innovation
practices to pursue the success of their business model and to build a
competitive advantage in the market.

In contract manufacturing, the OBM model represents a radical change of
the role in the existing market from the suppliers to second movers (Chu
2009). On the configuration of innovation practices, our results
indicate that OBM firms have strong engagement in all production works
as well as sustainable organizational management. As the latecomers in
the existing market, OBM firms have to improve technological innovation
capacity and change to high-value-added products, and they also need to
strengthen the marketing capabilities to more skilled operation and
value-added marketing activities in a competitive market (Eng and
Spickett-Jones 2009; Feng-Hsu, Heng-Yih, and Ting-Ling 2008; Wan 2015).
Moreover, the OBM firms also need sustainable organizational management
to make sure the run of business activities and to align the dynamic
changes in the market (Day 2006; Carayannis, Sindakis, and Walter 2015;
Foss and Saebi 2016).

After confirming the differentiated configuration of innovation
practices under OEM, ODM, and OBM models, this study also finds the
reconfiguration in the transition is the critical threshold to upgrade
the business models. Before the upgrade of OEM firms, we find a positive
change in organizational management but no significant changes in their
business activities compared to other OEM firms who have no intention to
change the business model. Many prior scholars indicate organizational
changes would influence the development of new capabilities and
partnership in business model innovation, and the upgrade of OEM firms
face a radical change to promote innovation practices for catching more
valued works in contract manufacturing. In other words, OEM firms need
to overcome the barriers of organizational inertia associated with the
old business model when they prepare to transit the upgraded business
model (Carayannis, Sindakis, and Walter 2015; Jacobides, MacDuffie, and
Tae 2016; Bijarboneh 2015). However, we do not find apparent changes
when ODM firms prepare to upgrade to the OBM model, and it only
indicates a significant reduction in process innovation for
manufacturing. In other words, ODM firms may concentrate on the
necessary process innovation to core products in branding development.

Furthermore, this paper compares the configuration of innovation
practices between new entrants and incumbent firms in the business model
of ODM and OBM. At the early stage in the transition from OEM to ODM, we
find that the new entrants of the ODM business have fewer new product
development and weak marketing capabilities compared to existing ODM
firms. For a new ODM firm, promoting the R&D and marketing works is the
determinant on the success of business model transition to build the
competence and business practices, but it needs a long-term path and
investment to transform into a new competitive advantage in the market
(Feng-Hsu, Heng-Yih, and Ting-Ling 2008; Eng and Spickett-Jones 2009;
Matthyssens, Vandenbempt, and Weyns 2009). In the transition to OBM
firms, the new entrants demonstrate strategic changes in a comprehensive
enhancement of production works and organizational management. It
indicates the new entrants of the OBM business need to pay more effort
to overcome the challenges in the competitive market as a second-mover
(Chu 2009; Lee, Song, and Kwak 2015; Yan 2012).

From the observation in the business model transition of Taiwanese
contract manufacturers, it indicates that the OEM-ODM-OBM path of
reinventing the business models exhibits the reconfiguration of business
activities by the value proposition in the market. The differentiated
configuration of innovation practices under these models shows the
composition of the firm's competence to fit the business activities of
the firms in the value chains. In the transition of the business model
of contract manufacturers, radical upgrading leads them a necessity to
promote the engagement of innovation practices that could adapt to the
new value proposition.

Conclusion and managerial implication
=====================================

By the rise of globalization, vertical specialization encouraged the
business model innovation in manufacturing sectors by contract
manufacturing in the existing market, and it provides the new business
opportunity to participate in the value chains for the latecomers in the
emerging economies, such as South Korea, Taiwan, and China. Through the
positioning of the business model, latecomers take parts of production
works as core business activities to create the values by the engagement
of innovation practices. In this study, it illustrates and demonstrates
the new business model of OEM, ODM, and OBM in contract manufacturing
for the latecomers.

In Taiwanese manufacturing sectors, by the growth of contract
manufacturing in emerging Asia, the regular competition leads to a
business model transition in OEM, ODM, and OBM are emerging from the
1990s (Hobday 1998). Many Taiwanese contract manufacturers pursue the
upgrading of business models to provide more added values to the
contractors by developing new business activities through the engagement
of innovation practices in production works as well as ongoing
organizational innovation to coordinate the run of new business. Many
success stories in the last 30 years on Taiwanese contract
manufacturers, such as Acer, Quanta Computer, Giant, Johnson, and HTC
(Hobday 1998; Chu 2009; Yan 2012), prove Taiwanese case as the good
referred model for the business model transition of contract
manufacturers.

Through the examination of the business model transition of Taiwanese
contract manufacturers, it could find that business model innovation
generates from the reposition of value proposition in the existing
market, which still takes parts of works in value chains (Zott and Amit
2010; Amit and Zott 2012; Johnson, Christensen, and Kagermann 2008). The
firms would illustrate their business activities and engagement of
innovation mix to provide the value to the customers in the existing
market, which they repositioned (Bucherer, Eisert, and Gassmann 2012;
Teece 2010). When the firm intends to reclaim their business models,
they will purchase the transition of innovation mix in production and
organizational works for reconfiguring their business activities to meet
the new value proposition in the existing market (Sánchez and Ricart
2010; Carayannis, Sindakis, and Walter 2015). In other words, it could
conclude that business model innovation rooted in value repositioning,
and the transition of the business model demonstrates in the
reconfiguration of the innovation mix to describe new business
activities. Therefore, the firms have to pay their effort to catch up on
the innovation practices in the business model transition.

In practical implication, this paper points out some challenges on the
upgrading of the business model to the latecomers. At first, although
the transition to ODM or OBM models aims to expand to R&D and marketing
works, there is a gap of capabilities to encourage new entrants in
building new configuration of innovation practices for reposition value
proposition in the market (Teece 2010; Euchner and Ganguly 2014).
Second, the tension of radical change from OEM to ODM exists in the
transition, and the competence on new product development in R&D and
marketing capabilities may need long term investment and accumulation
(Chesbrough 2010; Yan, Chiang, and Chien 2014). Third, organizational
management is the core mechanism to sustain the operation of business
activities and to foster the transition of the business model. On the
ODM and OBM models, adaptive organizational management could make the
firms have high flexibility to react to the dynamic changes in the
market by incorporating other business activities (Carayannis, Sindakis,
and Walter 2015; Koen, Bertels, and Elsum 2011). In the final, the
external network of partnership in contract manufacturing demonstrates
the combination of valued works in the value chains, and the
reassignment is the critical work in the operating business model to
implement the specialization practices in terms of attaining the value
proposition in the market (Sánchez and Ricart 2010; Hsu and Liu 2008).

In the future research, although the study finds different business
models in contract manufacturing that have focused on the various
business activities, and plot the transition of the business model,
there are two research limitations for further research. Although the
data of TIS2 and TIS3 across two periods have the consideration on time
horizontal, a time series analysis by consecutive years would provide
more dynamic observation in the business model transition of contract
manufacturers. Moreover, the Taiwanese case offers good evidence. Still,
different industrial contexts for each economy may lead to the necessity
of adjustment in the practices, and it would encourage the comparison
across different economies.
