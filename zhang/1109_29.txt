Hakka people have always been industrious and thrifty, as well as sincere and honest. In order to preserve foods, many techniques were developed to ferment and pickle foodstuffs in Hakka food and drink culture. One of the most representative is Hakka vinegar. "Brown Rice Vinegar" produced by Yang Da Biotech Company Limited uses strictly selected organic nutritious brown rice from friendly land in Pingtung. The fermentation process relies on a single bacterial culture in accordance with the traditional production method, and this is combined with modern technological fermentation production methods to completely retain the nutrients contained in the organic brown rice, brewing a healthy nutritious brown rice vinegar with a vigorous, robust, and natural mellow taste.
