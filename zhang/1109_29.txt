Hakka people have always been industrious and thrifty, as well as sincere and honest. In order to preserve foods, many techniques were developed to ferment and pickle foodstuffs in Hakka food and drink culture. One of the most representative is Hakka vinegar. "Brown Rice Vinegar" produced by Yang Da Biotech Company Limited uses strictly selected organic nutritious brown rice from friendly land in Pingtung. The fermentation process insists on using a single bacterial culture in accordance with the traditional production method, and combines this with modern technological fermentation production methods to completely retain the nutrients contained in the organic brown rice, brewing ahealthy nutritious brown rice vinegar with a vigorous, robust, and natural mellow taste.
