In order to create job opportunities and revive the economy in the disaster areas affected by Morakot typhoon, Sanford Technology Company Limited recruited local people from the redevelopment areas and assigned the work to produce the LED Cultural & Creative lamp "Morakot Light," which symbolizes the rebirth and first light of morning for the residents of the disaster areas affected by Morakot Typhoon undergoing redevelopment. The workmanship and styling of the lamp is exquisite, and is light and portable, making it suitable as a gift or for personal use.
