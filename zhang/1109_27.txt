In order to create job opportunities and revive the economy in disaster areas affected by the Morakot typhoon, Sanford Technology Company Limited recruited local people from the redevelopment areas and assigned them the work of producing the LED Cultural & Creative lamp "Morakot Light," which symbolizes the rebirth and first light of morning for the residents of the disaster areas now undergoing redevelopment. The workmanship and styling of the lamp is exquisite, and it is light and portable, making it suitable as a gift or for personal use.
