These Taiwanese soaps are produced through close cooperation with farmers and specialty products are selected and used that are representative of Hakka culture including jujubes, Leicha (Hakka Lei Tea, Hakka mashed tea), and persimmons. These are meticulously blended to produce a series of soap products including a brown sugar jujube skin care soap, Leicha skin cleaning healthy soap, and an "Everything is Good" persimmon soap that are full of the allure and charm of Hakka culture. These soaps have the capacity to make the skin tender and white, as well as provide a moisturizing effect, while at the same time removing dead skin cells. "Taiwanese soap," in our memories as a product that creates a sense of simplicity, purity, and reassurance, only uses a natural combination of oils and water so that there is no burden placed on the environment when used for bathing. The production process and use of these soaps hold fast to the environmental concept of being natural and pollution-free.
