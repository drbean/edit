Taiwanese soap is produced through close cooperation with farmers to select and use specialty products that are representative of Hakka culture including jujubes, Leicha (Hakka Lei Tea, Hakka mashed tea), and persimmons, which are meticulously blended to produce a series of soap products including a brown sugar jujube skin care soap, Leicha skin cleaning healthy soap, and an "Everything is Good" persimmon soap that are full of the allurement and charm of Hakka culture. These soaps have the capacity to make the skin tender and white, as well as provide a moisturizing effect, while at the same time removing dead skin cells. "Taiwanese soap" retains our memories of a product that creates a sense of simplicity, purity, and reassurance, and only uses a natural combination of oils and water so that there is no burden placed on the environment when used for bathing. The production process and use of these soaps hold fast to the environmental concept of natural and pollution-free.
