Mulberry Tourist Fruit Garden is located in the simple small town of Longtan Township in Taoyuan District. Ms. Chin-Chu Fan, business owner of Mulberry Tourist Fruit Garden, is firmly opposed to the use of any agricultural chemical pesticide or herbicide, and utilizes agricultural transformation technology to painstakingly cultivate each and every mulberry tree in her fruit farm. Ms. Fan operates a farm that provides a friendly environment so that when the fruit picking season approaches, visiting parents and their children revel in the fun of picking fruit in a natural, safe environment. With the idea of constructing a completely new experience workshop, the counseling provided by the program assisted in transforming the open space originally at the front into a red brick walled DIY experience area. The design of the experience area included windows that open on three sides to allow a gentle breeze to waft in. The area allows fruit picking visitors to conveniently enter, relax, sit down and savor some tea. A connection was provided to the adjoining indoor product sales area, which effectively integrates a visit access design. This is where white display racks are set up, completely filled with many kinds of fresh mulberry products for the convenience of visitors wishing to select and buy. In addition, Ms. Fan holds “slow” Hakka lifestyle experience classes at the fruit farm when it's not the fruit picking season. Topics include Lei Tea (Hakka mashed tea) DIY, and mulberry jam making. The aim is for visitors to Mulberry Garden to feel that they have arrived at a home away from home, where they can revel at ease, while having fun in the countryside.
