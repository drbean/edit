58 Degrees Bakery is promoting and providing assistance to local farmers in the Hakka district of Liudui Township in southern Taiwan, with its "Uncle" God as protecting guardian spirit, to grow cocoa trees. The planting, field management, and harvesting of cocoa trees is relatively easy, making it suitable not only for elderly farmers to farm, but also for young people considering joining the ranks in revitalizing the township. In addition, the younger generation are also being encouraged to become involved in creative thinking to collectively develop a wide range of innovative products based on cocoa, and to establish a self production, self-governed, and self marketing contract farming system. In this way a Liudui cocoa brand can be created, and a new cocoa township settlement established that is able to promote cocoa products to all parts of the country.
