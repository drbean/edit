58 Degrees Bakery adopts "Uncle" as the guardian to protect the Hakka native spirit, and promotes and provides assistance to local farmers in the Hakka district of Liudui Township in southern Taiwan to grow cocoa trees. The planting, field management, and harvesting of cocoa trees is relatively easy, making it suitable not only for elderly farmers to farm cocoa trees, but also encourages young people to join the ranks in revitalizing the township. In addition, the young generation are prompted to become involved in creative thinking to collectively develop a wide range of innovative products based on cocoa, and to establish a self production, self-governed, and self marketing contract farming system. In this way a Liudui cocoa brand can be created, and a new cocoa township settlement established that is able to promote cocoa products to all parts of the country.
