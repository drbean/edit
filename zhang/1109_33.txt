Xionglin Township in Hisnchu County is a typical small Hakka town, where the planting and cultivation of citrus tankan by Hakka people has a history of more than 150 years. This has given the area the not-undeserved reputation of being the "birthplace of citrus tankan." However, in recent years, intense market competition has resulted in farmers earning lower profits from the citrus, which has brought about a gradual recession in the local industry. Ten years ago, husband and wife Huang Kun-Ping and Lu Mei-Kui moved from Taipei to Xionglin Township and were saddened to see the lack of demand for citrus tankan, so they developed the "Tankan Cake." Embracing the concepts of naturalness, healthiness, and overall well-being, the tankan cakes have been warmly received and have earn honest praise from consumers, and have become locally well-known in the form of gift boxes as a souvenir, giving the traditional agriculture products a new lease of life.

Auntie's Lucky Workshop felt the need to cherish the blessing of this land. With this simple idea in mind, mulled over for some time, a "Happy Delivered Gift Box (Red Yeast Rice Fulong Cake, Pineapple Plum Cassia Cake, Sweet Strawberry Cake, Golden Lemon One Bite Cake)¡¨ was finally born. These ¡§Happy Delivery Gift Boxes¡¨ not only allow everyone to share and savor the most delicious and natural comfort fruit, but are also invested with a message of appreciation and concern for the well-being of the recipient's family.
