Xionglin Township in Hisnchu County is a typical small Hakka town, where the planting and cultivation of citrus tankan by Hakka ancestors has a history of more than 150 years. This has given the area the warm praise of being the "birthplace of citrus tankan." However, in recent years, intense market competition has resulted in farmers earning lower profits from the citrus tankan, which has brought about a gradual recession in the local industry. Ten years ago, husband and wife Huang Kun-Ping and Lu Mei-Kui moved from Taipei to Xionglin Township and were saddened to see the little demand for citrus tankan, so they developed the "Tankan Cake." Insisting on embracing the concepts of naturalness, healthiness, and overall well-being, the tankan cakes are warmly received and earn high praise from consumers, and have become locally well-known souvenir gift boxes,  bringing a new lease of life life to the to traditional agriculture products.

Auntie's lucky workshop cherishes the gift of this blessed piece of land.
