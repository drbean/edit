Bitter orange tea is rooted in the innate disposition of Hakka people with respect to their love and care for living things. The aged bitter orange tea is produced using a handicraft that follows a production method of ancient times that involves a complex procedure including a tempering process of "nine-time steaming and sunlight drying," and then three months of time-consuming work that requires repeated "steaming, pressing, sunlight drying, and baking." Yong Xiang Tea Store is taking an old industry and creating a new culture. What you drink is no longer merely a simple and honest mellow taste aged over a long period of time, but, more importantly, the wisdom handed down from our forefathers.
