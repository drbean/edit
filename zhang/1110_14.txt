In order to improve the particularly distinctive flavor of Hakka flat rice noodles, Mr. Shi-Min Liang, business owner of Li-Yuan Rice Products, continuously improved and introduced changes and new ideas to the manufacturing process. His exclusive refrigeration technology allowed the low temperature flat rice noodles to maintain their freshness and springiness after thawing while conserving their flavorsome taste. The technical counseling provided by the program focused on ISO22000 certification and HACCP international food safety certification, and delivering education and training courses to the staff to establish a perfect food safety standard operating procedure. The program implemented space optimization of the production environment and sterile and dust prevention in the factory inventory area, operations area, cooking area, and the packaging area to effectively achieve complete food safety control, thus providing diners the reassurance that the flat rice noodles they are consuming are safe to eat, and that they can freely indulge in savoring the unique flavor of Hakka flat rice noodles. In the future, the company will expand its distribution channels into the Japanese market, and eventually market Hakka traditional rice culture products worldwide.
