In order to improve the particularly distinctive flavor of Hakka flat rice noodles, Mr. Shi-Min Liang, business owner of Li-Yuan Rice Products, had previously followed a continuous improvement program to introduce changes and new ideas to the manufacturing process. His exclusive refrigeration technology allowed frozen flat rice noodles to maintain their freshness and springiness after thawing at the same time as they conserved their original taste. The technical counseling provided by the HAC program focused on HACCP international food safety and ISO22000 certification, and delivering staff education and training courses to completely establish standard food safety operating procedures. The program implemented space optimization of the production environment and sterilization and dust prevention in the factory inventory area, operations area, cooking area, and the packaging area to effectively achieve complete food safety control, thus providing diners the reassurance that the flat rice noodles they are consuming are safe to eat, and that they can freely indulge in the pleasure of savoring their unique flavor. In the future, the company intends to expand its distribution channels into the Japanese market, and eventually market Hakka traditional rice culture products worldwide.
