"Small Preserved Vegetables Meatballs" are produced using local preserved vegetables sourced from Gong Guan Township, which are combined with ground meat consisting of a mixture in the right proportion of lean and fatty meat, and then pickled using traditional Hakka methods. The meatball has been made smaller. The new one bite size, retaining the original Hakka flavor, encourages new and creative ways to eat meatballs.

"Hakka Salted Pork" is a dish prepared by the Hakka ethnic group in earlier times for offerings to gods or for ancestral ritual celebration purposes on New Year's Day or at other festivals. In order to extend its storage life, salt is used to pickle the pork. The pork used is specially selected streaky pork with the skin left on, and after pickling the pork is baked in an oven. This production process differs from the general one whereby the pork is first steamed and then deep fried, and lessens the burden which the food puts on the physical body.

"Hakka slow-braised pork belly" is also known as “Hakka Small Feng Meat,” with a production process involving "Slow fire, little water, an appetizing meal in itself when the heating control is complete." Full of Love Noodle Shop follows the traditional practice of previous generations cooking this succulent and appetizing dish with its special local Hakka flavor. Black pork cuts are specially selected. Garlic, soy sauce, rice wine, and a little rock sugar are then added and the pork is simmered until it is soft.
