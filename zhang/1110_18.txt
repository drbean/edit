Jiu Yi Qi (917) Delicious Food Workshop is located in Yuli Township, Hualien County, and Mr. Jin-Zhi Li, business owner of the workshop, loves nature and is a firm believer in ecological coexistence and the practice of organic agriculture. His fast selling products include organic green plums, Chike Mountain bitter tea, and roselle. Accordingly, the direction of counseling provided by the program focused on production process control and the introduction of sterilization technology. These two processes were undertaken to substantially reduce the waste of raw materials in inventory and the storage life of products under normal temperature conditions. In addition, home-grown ramtilla and coffee were used to further develop new products, including chrysanthemum tea bags and coffee enzyme, which effectively increased added value. The business operator is committed to organic agriculture, and processing and production, as well as the continued expansion of points of sale for his products. Mr. Li hopes to build a well-defined image of local home-grown organic products delivered directly from farm to the dining table, and thereby greatly reinforce consumer confidence in local organic agricultural products.
