Jiu Yi Qi (917) Delicious Food Workshop is located in Yuli Township, Hualien County, and Mr. Jin-Zhi Li, business owner of the workshop, advocates cherishing of nature and ecological coexistence, and insists on practicing organic agriculture. His fast selling products include organic green plums, Chike Mountain bitter tea, and roselle. Accordingly, the direction of counseling provided by the program focused on production process control of the products and the incorporation of sterilization technology. These two items were put into operation to substantially enhance the utilization rate of the raw materials inventory and the storage life of products under normal temperature conditions. In addition, home-grown ramtilla and coffee were made use of to further develop new products, including chrysanthemum tea bags and coffee enzyme, which effectively increased production value. The business operator is committed to organic agriculture, and related processing and production, as well as the continued expansion of points of sale for its products. Mr. Li hopes to convey a well-defined image of local home-grown organic products being sent directly to the dining table, and thereby greatly reinforce consumer confidence in local organic agricultural products.
