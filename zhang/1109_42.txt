"Welcoming Peanuts" selects and uses Taiwan Premium Peanuts No. 9 planted and grown in the Fenglin area of Hualien. The nuts are round and full, crunchy and tasty, and replete with a mouth-watering fragrance. The skin is removed from the peanuts and stir fried together with hot peppers, chilies, and a variety of meticulously developed spices. The resulting peanuts have an original taste that is "spicy but not peppery hot, crispy but not oily." And because of their strong spicy flavor, after people have eaten these peanuts, they suck on their fingers to savor the aftertaste with an irresistible sense of not being able to let go!

Dragon Roasted Kung Fu Tea is produced using an ancient production process that has been handed down through the generations of grandfathers and fathers, whereby Dong Ding oolong tea leaves are roasted with a slow fire using longan wood. The tea has distinctive characteristics including a fragrant bouquet and mellow taste; moreover, the tea leaves can be infused many times and can be stored for long periods of time, with an aroma no machine can reproduce. The tea leaves undergo a deeper fermentation process that produces a darker colored, bright orange tea drink. When smelled, a refreshing fragrance strikes the nose, and when sipped, a mouth-watering sensation arises on the palate, with a moistening sweet aftertaste as it enters the throat and a charcoal roast taste that lingers without end!

Using pineapples specially selected from the Neipu area of Pingtung, the fresh pineapple fruit is first cut into angled pieces and heated. Special attention is paid to not only the knife used in the cutting process, but also overturns the traditional Hakka pickling production method by instead subjecting the pineapple pieces to an interactive cyclic baking process that involves cold blasts at a low temperature of 40 degrees. This process retains the elasticity of the pineapple fruit flesh, and locks in the flavor of the fresh fruit. Therefore, using this unique technology enables the company to produce high-fiber health foods and create a new generation of Hakka flavors.
