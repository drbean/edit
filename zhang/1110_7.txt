Ms. Xuan Lai, the third generation business owner of Nong Yu Rice Store, is committed to the research and development of organic rice, and continuously promotes her series of gift boxes packed with manually, finely screened rice and customized services, as well as making use of various Hakka cotton prints to incorporate into the product package designs to vividly evoke the rich and abundant imagery of Hakka rural communities. To accomplish the objectives of the counseling program, the interior area was remodeled by redecorating the entire background to create a serene and tranquil color scheme that effectively sets off the charming points of the rice gift boxes wrapped in a variety of colorful cotton prints. In addition, the counseling program included planning out a working area to provide the staff working indoors with ample space to carry out packaging operations. Moreover, in the product display area, a storage cabinet modeled after a Hakka meat safe was designed, and Hakka cotton prints were joined together to form door leaves that vividly charge the area with the irresistible attraction and charm of Hakka culture. In the future, Nong Yu Rice Store will open the second floor to public access in order to bring together local craftspeople or featured chefs from time to time, and put on display works of artistic craftsmanship, or hold Hakka culinary experience classes for visitors in order to keep alive fond recollections of Hakka rice products.
