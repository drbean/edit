Ms. Xuan Lai, the third generation business owner of Nong Yu Rice Store, is committed to the research and development of organic rice, and continues uninterrupted efforts to promote her series of gift box packs of fine manually-screened rice and other customized rice services. The use of Hakka cotton prints incorporated into the product package designs vividly evokes the rich and diverse imagery of rice in Hakka rural communities. To accomplish the objectives of the counseling program, the interior area was remodeled, and all the walls redecorated to create a serene and tranquil color scheme that effectively sets off the charm of the rice gift boxes wrapped in colorful cotton prints. In addition, the counseling program included the planning of a work area to provide the staff working indoors with ample space to carry out packaging. Moreover, in the product display area, a storage cabinet modeled after a Hakka meat safe was placed, and Hakka cotton prints were combined on door leaves that vividly charge the area with the irresistible attraction and charm of Hakka culture. In the future, Nong Yu Rice Store will open the second floor to public access. The plan is to bring together local craftspeople or featured chefs from time to time, and to put on display works of artistic craftsmanship or hold Hakka culinary experience classes for visitors in order to keep alive their fond recollections of Hakka rice traditions.
