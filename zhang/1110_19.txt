The famous pumpkin rice cake of Qin Shui Xuan Western Bread uses pumpkins grown by local farms and rice produced in the Guan Shan area of Taitung County. Because of the natural ingredients used and their high nutritional content, it is just not possible to store the pumpkin rice cake for any length of time. Hence, in order to extend the eat-by dates the company could recommend, Ms. Mei-Hui Kao, business owner of Qinshui Xuan Western Bread, devoted time and effort to breaking new ground in this problem. She finally came up with a solution incorporating nitrogen preservation technology and microbial inhibition technology in the packaging process. Experimental data shows that the recommended eat-by date can be extended to seven days, six days more than the original one day expiry date. In addition, in the past, the flavorsome taste of pumpkin rice cakes could only be enjoyed in the local area where they were baked. However, through the above technological innovation in the production process, the product's distribution channels have now expanded to online shopping, and the pumpkin rice cakes can be home delivered to all parts of the country, thus allowing even more consumers to relish one of the delicious Hakka flavors from Taitung County.
