Ding Xin Industrial Company Limited carries on the manual wine making tradition of the older generation, but combines this with the creative thinking of the younger generation to intermix natural fermented distillers' grains with palm grass that is customarily used in traditional Hakka communities. Using this procedure, an age-old fragrance permeates the handmade soap, and the mild, smooth and relaxing pleasant bouquet nourishes and takes good care of every inch of your skin, just like in the past when palm grass was used to meticulous care for and safeguard each and every Hakka women.

Upholding the traditional, natural, and hand-made wine making techniques, Ding Xin Industrial Company Limited selects their own pure distillers' grain water to produce handmade soap. Natural distillers' grains nourish the skin to make it finer and more silky smooth, with the addition of indian epimerdei and hibiscus leaves customarily used in traditional Hakka communities that are able to quieten the spirit and calm the soul, this soap brings each user peace in mind and body.
