Ding Xin Industrial Company Limited carries on the wine making tradition of the older generation where everything is done by hand. But it combines this with the creative thinking of the younger generation to intermix the natural fermented distillers grains that result from this process with the palm grass that is customarily used in traditional Hakka communities to make soap. Using this procedure, a time-honored fragrance permeates the handmade soap, and the mild, smooth and relaxing pleasant bouquet nourishes and takes good care of every inch of your skin, just like in the past when palm grass was used to meticulously care for and safeguard the skin of each and every Hakka women.

Following traditional, natural, and by-hand wine making techniques, Ding Xin Industrial Company Limited selects their own pure distillers grain water to produce handmade soap. Natural distillers grains nourish the skin to make it finer and more silky smooth, and with the addition of the indian epimerdei and hibiscus leaves customarily used in traditional Hakka communities to quieten the spirit and calm the soul, this soap brings each user peace in mind and body.
