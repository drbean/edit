When the autumn sun causes the winds of September to blow, the golden yellow festival event for drying persimmons in the sun has arrived, and is Taiwan's most beautiful Hakka cultural scene. The procedure for producing the Chin Kee dried persimmons has been passed down through three generations, and follows an ancient production process. Once the Mid-Autumn Festival is over, the moist, mouth watering persimmons arranged on racks will have absorbed the maximum sunlight, attracting consumers who vie with each other to rush and buy the dried persimmons - clear evidence of the irresistible lure of Hsinchu persimmons.
