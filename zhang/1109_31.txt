When the autumn sun causes the winds of September to blow, the time for the golden yellow festival event for drying persimmons in the sun--Taiwan's most beautiful Hakka cultural scene--has arrived. The procedure for producing the Chin Kee dried persimmons has been passed down through three generations, and follows an ancient production process. Once the Mid-Autumn Festival is over, the moist, mouth watering persimmons arranged on racks will have absorbed the maximum amount of sunlight, attracting consumers who rush in, vying with each other to buy the dried persimmons - clear evidence of the irresistible lure of Hsinchu persimmons.
