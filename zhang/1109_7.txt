Miaoli County Joy Student Assistance Social Care Association focuses on assisting the physically and mentally handicapped, as well as middle and old age senior citizens. The Association draws on plant dyeing techniques assimilated into "Hakka blue dye, Hakka cotton prints" to form products having commercial value, such as blue dyed Hakka cotton print cloth bags and clothing. This is not only reviving the Miaoli Hakka specialty products industry, but also enabling disadvantaged job seekers to be self sufficient, thereby achieving the objective of strategic alliance and sharing of resources.
