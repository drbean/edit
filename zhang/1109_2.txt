The product of a Hakka mountain town teeming with the milk of Hakka kindness, and the hard working, sincere and honest Hakka way of life, this rich and down-to-earth Hakka delicacy is a most precious gift made from the "sweet-scented osmanthus." A group of advertising agency workers who had grown up in the town carefully select featured agricultural products of the local Hakka community, which then undergo a meticulous production process to finally produce a souvenir gift in a box containing the precious osmanthus and tea leaves. The Golden Daily Lily Gift Box set of the highest quality is offered to the customer in the hope that it can be presented as a gift in a meaningful way, when an insistence on fine flavors, and an expectation of healthy products is required, just like a mother would take care of her children.
