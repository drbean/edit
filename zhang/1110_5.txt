As you walk along the side of the popular bicycle scenic route "Houfeng Bikeway" in Taichung City, you are very quickly attracted by a European style manor building on a rural forest road - this is the well-known "Railway Valley Winery." The specially selected ingredients used in making the wine at this winery all come from Hakka local fruit grown in the Dongshi district of Taichung City. The diverse variety of wines and unique flavors are what hold the deep and ardent affection of its loyal consumers. In order to bring to the fore the distinguishing features of the winery, the space reconstruction of the program counseling included creating a model of a wine cask as the brand identity of the winery, and placing it in an outdoor region with the purpose of catching the eyes of visitors as they pass by, as well as noticeably improving the visual image of the entrance. In addition, after remodeling the first floor product sales area, a three-dimensional design concept was employed to construct display stands in the form of a concave-convex changing pattern of layers using logs. The resulting construction effectively conveys a visual effect similar to that of a stack of wooden wine casks, and creates an impromptu and casual feel to the winery. Moreover, the overall effect gives expression to the defining characteristics of the various kinds of carefully selected wines, and elevates the interest and charm of the entire winery, as well as promoting local featured agriculture products and tourism.
