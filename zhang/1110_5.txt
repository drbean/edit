As you walk along the popular scenic "Houfeng Bikeway" in Taichung City, you will very quickly notice an attractive European-style manor building on a rural forest road - the well-known "Railway Valley Winery." The specially selected ingredients used in making the wine at this winery all come from local Hakka fruit grown in the Dongshi district of Taichung City. The different varieties of wines and their unique flavors are what earn the deep and ardent affection of their loyal consumers. In order to bring to the fore the distinguishing features of the winery, the space reconstruction pursued by the program included creating a model wine cask to provide a brand identity for the winery, and placing it outdoors to catch the eye of passers-by. This noticeably improved the visual effect achieved at the entrance. In addition, remodeling the first floor product sales area, a three-dimensional design approach was employed with display stands constructed in a flowing concave-convex pattern using layers of logs. The resulting construction effectively had a visual effect similar to that of a stack of wooden wine casks, and imparts an impromptu and casual feel to the winery. The overall effect gives expression to the defining characteristics of the different varieties of the winery's carefully selected wines, and elevates the interest and charm of the entire compound, as well as more narrowly promoting featured local agriculture products and tourism.
