Previous generations of Hakka people used wind grass specifically for lying-in women to bathe with, and had the effect of dilating blood vessels and lowering blood pressure, as well being a natural plant with the capacity to dispel wind and reduce swelling, facilitate the flow of blood, and eliminate stagnant blood. The wind grass planted in Hakka communities is blended together with natural vanilla herb plant extract to produce handmade postpartum recuperation soap that is convenient to use by women during their postpartum recuperation month.
