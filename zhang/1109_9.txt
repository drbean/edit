Previous generations of Hakka people used wind grass specifically for lying-in women to bathe with. It had the effect of dilating blood vessels and lowering blood pressure, being a natural plant with the capacity to dispel wind and reduce swelling, facilitate the flow of blood, and eliminate stagnant blood. The wind grass grown in Hakka communities is blended together with natural herb extract to produce handmade postpartum recuperation soap that is convenient to use by women during their postpartum recuperation month.
