After Mr. Tseng-Kun Wen, founder of Hsin Yuan Chang Black Tea Company, moved to Taitung from Kuanhsi in Hsinchu County, he invested time and effort in promoting Taitung's black tea industry.  Wen's Hsin Yuan Black tea is now a time-honored brand from Luye Township of Taitung County, with the support of both his old and new acquaintances becoming a major tea of the local tea-making industry. As part of the counseling program and in order to strengthen corporate identity recognition, the Chinese character "昌(Chang)" was taken and morphed into a tea leaf to serve as the corporate logo, endowing the brand with an extra brightness (昌). An extended design process also resulted in the creation of a mascot character, Tea Treasure for the business to develop later. The design of the outdoor signboard represents an abundant tea harvest, and when lit up at night in the twilight sky is a representative image from Luye Township. Currently, it is planned to renovate the factory attic, with the intention of it becoming a DIY experience area, and an area for presenting the tea production process of tea leaf rolling, fermentation, and drying. Displays and guided tours will be undertaken in order to pass on the experience and knowledge of tea making to future generations. In the future, Hsin Yuan Chang hopes to incorporate tea making's own special cultural characteristics to make the site a local tourist hot spot.
