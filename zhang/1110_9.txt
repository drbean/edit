After Mr. Tseng-Kun Wen, founder of Hsin Yuan Chang Black Tea Company, moved to Taitung from Kuanhsi in Hsinchu County, he invested all his time and effort in promoting Taitung's black tea industry.  Hsin Yuan Black tea is now a time-honored brand in Luye Township of Taitung county, and, with the support of both his old and new acquaintances, has become a major indicator of the local tea-making industry. In order to strengthen the corporate identity system, the Chinese character "æ˜Œ(Chang)" was especially redesigned into a tea leaf symbol to serve as the corporate logo and to endow the brand with a new purpose. Furthermore, through an extended design process, an exclusive mascot "tea treasure" was created for business operators to adapt for successive development. The design of the outdoor signboard presented the imagery of an abundant harvest of tea leaves, and when the signboard is suspended low in the twilight sky and lit up, it becomes a representative scenic view of Luye Township. Currently, it is planned to renovate the factory attic, with the intention of it becoming a DIY experience area, and for it to become an area for presenting the tea production process of tea leaves rolling, fermentation, and drying through displays and guided tours in order to pass on the experience and knowledge of tea making to future generations. In the future, Hsin Yuan Chang hopes to incorporate its own cultural characteristics of tea making for it to become a local tourist hot spot.
