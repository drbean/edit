Geng Hsin Organic Vegetable Farm is located in Liudui, Pingtung County, and grows numerous organic agricultural products. Geng Hsin Company, owned and run by Mr. Ri-He Liu, processes and ferments the harvested miracle fruit itself to produce fruit enzyme, and makes use of the pomace obtained after fermentation to form natural compost. However, this composting of the fruit pomace is of very little economic benefit to the company, thus, Mr. Liu hoped to effectively enhance the added value of his agricultural product through the development of a pet food formula. The technology involves cold wind drying and grinding into powder a large quantity of residual miracle fruit pomace, which is then made up into a nutritious formula that is added to the ingredients of pet cookies, thus developing a market for natural pet foods, The nutrient content has passed allergy testing standards, which guarantees the safety of the products when eaten by pets. The aim is also to use the development of this technology to increase the added value of agricultural products and open up the pet food market.
