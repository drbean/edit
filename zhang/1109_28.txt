Using indica rice, milk, brown sugar and other food materials, creative ingenuity is employed to bring into play the distinctive characteristics of the ingredients and masterfully transform Hakka water bantiao and multi-layered bantiao into "rice cheese" - a well-loved dessert of the younger generation.

A harmonious blending of Penglai rice and indica rice combined with fermentation technology and cake baking skills has brought new ideas into baking, transforming the traditional Hakka steamed sponge cake into a cake made from rice that is now a favorite of the general public.

The offering of steamed sponge cakes for worship during the Spring Festival holidays is a practical expression of Hakka culture during this joyous and festive occasion. However, disposing of the steamed sponge cakes after the worshiping is over is not only a waste of food but also disrespectful of the cultural heritage. Dr. Tu's Health Preserving Vegetable Garden has brought ingenuity and creativity to bear, transforming the traditional steamed cakes into lush, brightly colored "Micaron" rice cup cakes that are similar to French Macaron Cakes. The real hope is that they become everyone's favorite, as at the same time they propagate the Hakka spirit of loving and caring for all living things.
