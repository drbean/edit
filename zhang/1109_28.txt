Using food materials including indica rice, milk, and brown sugar, creative ingenuity is employed that brings into play the distinctive characteristics of the ingredients to masterly transform Hakka water bantiao and multi-layered bantiao into the dessert "rice cheese" - a well-loved dessert of the younger generation.

A harmonious blending of Penglai rice and indica rice combined with fermentation technology and cake baking skills have brought new ideas into transforming the traditional Hakka steamed sponge cake into a cake made from rice that has become a favorite of the general public.

The offering of steamed sponge cakes for worship during the Spring Festival holidays is a practical expression of Hakka culture during this joyous and festive occasion. However, disposing of the steamed sponge cakes after the worshiping is over is not only a waste of food but also disrespectful of the cultural heritage. Dr. Tu's Health Preserving Vegetable Garden has brought ingenuity and creativity to transform the traditional steamed sponge cakes into lush, brightly colored "Micaron" rice cup cakes that are similar to the French Macaron Cakes. The real hope is that they become everyone's favorite, while at the same time propagating the Hakka spirit of loving and caring for all living things.
