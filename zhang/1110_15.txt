Quan Ming Sericulture Enterprise is located in Shitan Township, Miaoli County. After the government implemented "voluntary transfers to abolish the cultivation of silkworms program" (a policy to encourage growers to move out of the industry) in 1999, there was a sudden and drastic reduction in the originally small number of companies that were part of the sericulture industry. In order to preserve what remained of the Hakka industry, Mr. Quan-Ming Tu, business owner of Quan-Ming Sericulture Enterprise, began to think about a conceptual transformation in the industry, and devoted himself to the application of experiential teaching showing how to operate an ecological farm and develop peripheral merchandise. The technical counseling provided by the program assisted him in transforming the traditional sericulture company into one producing medical beauty care products. The use of scaled-up manufacturing technology for extracting protein from silk, and success in verifying its moisturizing effect, showed that silk protein extraction had an application in the development of raw material for use in food and cosmetic skin care products, and thereby increase the added value of traditional agricultural products. In the future, the new scaled-up technology will allow silk protein extraction on a mass production scale, enabling the sericulture industry to provide raw materials to domestic food product business operators and cosmetic skin care products companies, and thus expand distribution and create new value for Miaoli speciality industries.
