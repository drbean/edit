Quan Ming Sericulture Enterprise is located in Shitan Township, Miaoli County. After the government implemented the "voluntary transfer to abolish cultivation of silkworms program" in 1999, there was a sudden and drastic reduction in the originally small number of companies that were part of the sericulture industry. In order to preserve what remains of the Hakka industries, Mr. Quan-Ming Tu, business owner of Quan-Ming Sericulture Enterprise, began to think about a conceptual transformation in the sericulture industry, and devoted himself to the application of experiential teaching on how to operate an ecological farm and develop peripheral merchandise. The technical counseling provided by the program assisted in transforming the traditional sericulture industry into one producing medical beauty care products. The use of scaled-up manufacturing technology for extracting protein from silk, and success in verifying its moisturizing effect, proved that the application of extracting protein from silk can be extended to use as raw material for food or cosmetic skin care products, and thereby increase the high added value of traditional agricultural products. In the future, the new scaled-up technology not only provides a technique for extracting protein from silk on a mass production scale, but also enables the sericulture industry to provide raw materials to domestic food products business operators or cosmetic skin care products companies, and thus expanding distribution channels and creating new value for Miaoli speciality industries.
