The indigenous cinnamon trees all over Fenglin Township in Hualien County originate from the hands of Wenberli business owner Mr. Jin-Zhou Wen. He actively set into motion the concept of non-toxic cinnamon agriculture, and researched the nutrient content of the Chinese cinnamon tree so as to make the best use of cinnamon essence. Furthermore, Mr. Wen devotes himself to developing new food products and beverages, as well as cosmetic products incorporating the spice. Because of the continuing increase in the range of product categories, space remodeling carried out through the counseling program focused on the sales space area and the reception area for guests, changing them into a visitor area and a customized Fenglin guide station. A Fenglin Chinese cinnamon tree image was integrated into the outdoor signboard to greatly enhance brand recognition. When guests open the door they enter a room where the sweet fragrant aroma of the cinnamon tree is pervasive, accentuating this feeling. In addition, the product display shelves are now segmented according to product features, thereby allowing the consumer to more easily shop according to their needs. An image wall also prominently displays Fenglin Indigenous Cinnamon Tree Award achievements, Wenberli's history and its love and cherishment of natural resources.
