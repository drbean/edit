The indigenous cinnamon trees covering the whole land of Fenglin Township in Hualien County originate from the hands of Wenberli business owner Mr. Jin-Zhou Wen. He actively set into motion the concept of non-toxic agriculture, and researched the nutrient content of the Chinese cinnamon tree so as to make the best use of the cinnamon essence. Furthermore, Mr. Wen devoted himself to developing related food products and beverages, as well as cosmetic products. Hence, because of the continual increase in the range of product categories, the space remodeling carried out through the counseling program redesigned the sales space area and the reception area for welcoming guests, and changed them into a visitor area and a Fenglin customized guide station. A Fenglin Chinese cinnamon tree image was integrated into the outdoor signboard to greatly enhance the business identification, so that when guests enter the door they are able to experience a feeling of a room pervading with the sweet fragrant aroma of the cinnamon tree. In addition, the product display shelves are now segmented according to product features, thereby allowing the consumer to shop according to their needs. An image wall also prominently displays the Fenglin Indigenous Cinnamon Tree Award achievement and the development history of Wenberliâ€™s love and cherishment of natural resources.
