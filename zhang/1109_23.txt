”Joe's Smoked Sausages” of Hualien carefully selects its cured fresh meat from the early morning market, and then uses a seasoning recipe that has been passed down through generations in Joe's family. The aroma is distinctive with absolutely no addition of coloring or preservatives. The recipe for its sausages further includes blending in Yushan Kaoliang liquor, that is 58 percent alcohol, produced by Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Corporation, and aged distilled Hakka red yeast rice. The procedure for producing the sausages follows an ancient soaking process of the honest-to-goodness ingredients that the superior Joe's Smoked Sausage is famous for. Deep affections and the abiding memories of the Hakka people are kneaded into each string of "Hakka Sausage" produced by Chun Xiang Fine Foods. Joe looks forward to the traditional blissful taste of Hakka cuisine continuing to be handed down from generation to generation, and awaits even more eagerly to being moved emotionally by the sparkle in your eyes at that time you bite into a Hakka sausage.
