kka Affairs Council strives to provide counseling and assistance to Hakka characteristic industry. For the tenth anniversary of the plan, the Council adopts the core strategy of “industrializing Hakka culture, culturalizing Hakka industry” and leads over 500 companies of Hakka characteristic industry to jointly establish the excellent brand image of Hakka TAIWAN, marketing and promoting over 800 excellent Hakka products to major domestic and overseas distributors. Not only is the Council spreading Hakka’s cultural beauty and strengths globally, we are also showing the world newest bright spots of Hakka industry. 

This year’s plan features three major categories: “Product Package Design,” “Service and Experiential Space Renovation,” and “Product Quality and Technical Upgrade.” It marks the first time in history that the Council provides assistance in the “Product Quality and Technical Upgrade” area, helping 9 companies with great potentials. By assisting the companies in new patent and technical development, improvement of production process, enhancement of production, and obtaining of international food safety certification, the Council injects new energy for Hakka industry to leap onto the global stage, showcasing Hakka soft power. Also, nine other companies are selected for the “Service and Experiential Space Renovation” plan. Focusing on aspects of place, space, service path, and experiential activity, the Council helps the companies to refine and redefine the core values of Hakka characteristic products and further nurture the Hakka culture, propelling the development of Hakka industry in Taiwan. 

The accomplishments of this year’s plan fully display the spirit of “Hakka Innovation.” Over 150 cases of Hakka TAIWAN creative souvenir, unique Hakka services and experiential attraction, and technical upgrade are collected in this catalogue, so that everyone can see the richness of Hakka culture in all aspects of life. Of course, this catalogue can serve as a wonderful reference when selecting presents and gifts for holidays and special events and looking for partners for technical collaboration and exchange. 

The Council introduces the Hakka trilogy, “Seeing Hakka, Innovating Hakka, Sustaining Hakka,” and will adopt more advanced methods in the future to integrate the supply chain of Hakka characteristic industry, providing services for interdisciplinary industrial innovation cluster development and value-added services of ICT. We will continue fostering Hakka industry to achieve sustainable productivity. We will also continue to reinvent and diversity the industry, inviting younger generations to showcase their innovation and creativity to jointly “Sustain Hakka.”
