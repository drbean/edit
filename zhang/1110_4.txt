Jiang Ji Yung An Cakes is a famous local cake shop in Miaoli, and has an endless stream of visitors who had difficulty squeezing into the originally narrow and confined shop space, where they became packed like sardines. Hence, the counseling provided by the program first and foremost sought to replan the layout and how visitors moved through the store, rearranging the positions of the sample tasting area, display area, and the cashier area to provide a much smoother shopping experience for customers. Next, it was decided the original counter area in the sample tasting area was far too small. Thus, the length of the tasting table was made longer to make it more convenient for customers to taste products before deciding which ones they wantedÂ­to purchase. Moreover, it was realized a traditional Hakka dining table was made to order for the tasting table. In addition, planning of the layout and the customer lines included re-siting the counter to a position before an aqua blue Hakka culture story wall to allow customers waiting to pay for their purchases to not only learn about the history of the shop and its brand development, but also to achieve the objective of passing on the legacy and significance of Hakka culture. Furthermore, using designs based on the traditional cake production process and characteristic local scenery, paper-cut illustration design techniques were employed to uniquely create ten types of sample tasting plates, as well as a series of sample tasting plates to serve as souvenir gifts that customers could take delicious Hakka cakes home in and use as a memento of the deep and genuine affection shown by the Hakka people.
