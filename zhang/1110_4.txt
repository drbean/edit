Jiang Ji Yung An Cakes is a famous local cake shop in Miaoli, and has an endless stream of visitors to the shop who squeeze into the original narrow and small shop space, becoming packed like sardines. Hence, the counseling provided by the program first and foremost re-planned the spatial design and visitor flow of the store, which involved rearranging the positions of the sample tasting area, display area, and the cashier area to provide a much smoother shopping flow of customers. Next, the original counter area in the sample tasting area was far too small, thus, the length of the tasting table was made longer to make it more convenient for customers to taste, select, and choose the products they want Â­to purchase; moreover, a traditional Hakka dining table element was made to order to serve as the tasting table. In addition, the spatial design and visitor flow planning included rearranging the position of the counter in the visitor flow, and was finished with a complementing aqua blue Hakka culture story wall to allow consumers to take advantage of the time while waiting to pay for their purchases to learn about the history of the shop's brand development, and to achieve the objective of passing on the legacy and significance of Hakka culture. Furthermore, using designs based on the traditional cake production process and local characteristic scenery, paper-cut illustration design techniques were employed to uniquely create ten types of sample tasting plates, as well as a series of sample tasting plates to serve as souvenir gifts to allow customers to not only carry away delicious Hakka cakes but also be touched by the deep and genuine affection shown by Hakka people.
