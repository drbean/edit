A-Kuei Natural DIY Workshop upholds the philosophy of preserving nature, and uses natural health preserving pure black beans as well as employing local cinnamon and other natural ingredients. A-Kuei adheres to the ancient method of fermentation, which follows a prescribed 
order with no corners being cut under any circumstances, and insists on mature sauce ingredients undergoing fermentation for six months before allowing the soya sauce to be sold to the consumer. Natural soy sauce is the condiment second to none for cooking and marinating food material. By including soya sauce, the longer the food is cooked the more fragrant and sweet is the finished cooked dish, and is an absolutely indispensable and integral part of cooked dishes in Hakka cuisine.
