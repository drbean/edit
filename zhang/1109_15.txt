A-Kuei Natural DIY Workshop upholds the philosophy of preserving nature, and in its soya sauce, it uses natural health-preserving pure black beans as well as local cinnamon and other natural ingredients. A-Kuei adheres to the ancient method of fermentation, following the prescribed order with no corners being cut under any circumstances. It insists on mature sauce ingredients undergoing fermentation for six months before allowing the sauce to be sold to the consumer. Natural soy sauce is a condiment second to none for cooking and marinating food material. By including soya sauce, the longer the food is cooked the more fragrant and sweet is the finished cooked dish, and the sauce is thus an absolutely indispensable and integral part of cooked dishes in Hakka cuisine.
