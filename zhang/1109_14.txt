Hakka bamboo basket cups and saucers are produced using special pottery weaving technology. Destroying the image usually associated with general cups and saucers, the cups and saucers look like hollow-cut woven objects, but, contrary to appearance, can be filled with beverages. Tong Jing Xianfeng integrates Hakka tea picking scenes into the pottery to present a highly-refined cup and saucer set having pronounced and distinctive Hakka characteristics. Whether drinking tea or savoring a cup of coffee, you will not only experience the elegance of the bamboo basket cup, but also call to mind the hard work and delight enjoyed by tea farmers and tea picking scenes of Hakka folk singing folk songs.
