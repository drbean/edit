MAOLI Hakka Food Restaurant upholds the cultural heritage of Hakka cuisine. Its Hakka specialty pickled products include dried radish and radish strips as their principal items. The ingredients used as fillings include natural colors, and seasonal fresh vegetables, which are infused with modern creative thinking to roll out traditional Hakka rice sanbao (three treasures) “shell flower leaf dumpling, glutinous rice cake, water bantiao,” and creatively styled Hakka Sixi vegetable buns “flowers bloom bringing riches and promotion.” These products carry on the heritage of genuine and delicious flavors of Hakka cuisine from Taiwan.
