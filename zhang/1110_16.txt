Mr. Sheng-Te Guo, business owner of Guo Jia Zhuang Pickle Shop, is a second-generation successor to the business. Mr. Guo has preserved the traditional handmade pickling art, and continues working to develop new types of pickles. He is committed to strict oversight of the production process. The ISO22000 and HACCP international food safety certification counseling provided by the program resulted in re-evaulation of hygiene in the factory area and re-planning of the production process. In addition, employee education and staff training programs in quality certification standards were conducted during the counseling period so that the production process could meet food safety criteria. The program also focused on environmental hygiene with respect to maintenance of physical facilities in the factory area. For example, production and operations preparation were originally conducted under a corrugated iron roof, so a ceiling was added to enable effective control of food hygiene. In the future, plans are also in hand to expand the factory operations to include a food hygiene and tourist facility. 
Guo Jia Zhuang Pickle Shop is committed to destroying traditional ideas about handmade pickles of days gone by, and to upgrading traditional Hakka pickled product standards to meet international food safety levels so as to attract even more domestic and foreign tourists to the excellent locally made pickle flavors. The company hopes to become a major driving force in the development of Hakka pickles.
