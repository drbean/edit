Mr. Sheng-Te Guo, business owner of Guo Jia Zhuang Pickle Shop, is the second generation successor to the business. Mr. Guo has preserved the traditional handmade pickling art, and continues working to develop new types of pickles. He is committed to the strict control of the production process. The ISO22000 and HACCP international food safety certification counseling provided by the program re-inspected the environment of the factory area and re-planned the production process, in addition, education and training programs in quality certification specifications were conducted for employees during the counseling period in order for the production process to achieve food safety criterion. The program also focused on environmental sanitation control with respect to maintenance of physical facilities in the factory area. For example, the production and operations preparation area was originally constructed from iron sheets, so a ceiling was added to the construction to enable effective control of food safety. In the future, plans are also in hand to expand the factory operations to include a food safety and sanitation tourist factory. 
Guo Jia Zhuang Pickle Shop is committed to destroying the traditional concept associated with handmade pickles of days gone by, and will upgrade traditional Hakka pickled products to meet the international food safety grade so as to attract even more domestic and foreign tourists to taste the excellent locally made pickle flavors. The company hopes to become a major driving force for the development of Hakka pickles.
