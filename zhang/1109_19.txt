Oriental Beauty Tea, formerly known as "Peng Feng Tea (a local dialect pronunciation meaning "Bragger's Tea)," is an amber colored tea with a smooth non-bitter taste and a hint of a natural fruity flavor. Because of its distinctive flavor, this Oriental Beauty Tea is extremely popular, and is a major featured product of the Beipu tea industry. Guang Jun Tea is using a special Tourism Factory to promote Hakka tea culture and allow visitors to directly experience the tea making process.
