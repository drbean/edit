In order to keep meat and other food material for an extended period of time, earlier generations of Hakka people used a salting and drying process. However, the resulting flavor was inclined to be overly salty and oily. In response to the tastes and habits of modern people, while, however, retaining the traditional taste of earlier times, Jing Fa Storeâ€™s "Cured Meats" places an additional extra emphasis on imparting a characteristic flavor and encouraging healthy eating. Therefore, the salt content is reduced and no preservatives or nitrites are added. Traditional Hakka culinary skills are adhered to, using sugar cane to smoke the meats. Moreover, even though the production and working procedure are complex and intricate, a manual production process is still adopted.
