Now in the hands of the third generation, Dong Bao Black Pork Store raises and cares for Taiwan’s indigenous “Liudui black pigs” through humanitarian means, and includes broadcasting the flowing melody of classical music in the pigpen to create a happy and pleasant atmosphere for the black pigs. Because of their fresh and superior quality without the addition of any kind of lean meat powder (clenbuterol, ractopamine) or antibiotics, the Dong Bao Black Pork meat products are implicitly trusted by the public. However, because of the narrow and cramped space allocated for selling the meat products, the store access flow for customers as they shop is below the required standard, moreover, the shop front is located on a downhill section of the road, which makes it difficult for visitors to single out as they pass by. Hence, the work carried out in the counseling program included redesigning the height of an external wall, and revising the company logo. In addition, the interior of the store was decoratively arranged with the representative flower of the Hakka community of Liudui in Pingtung - the China Rose (hibiscus rosa-sinensis), for the purpose of creating a space for welcoming visitors that conveyed the underlying meaning of the full wealth of Hakka culture. Furthermore, three sales areas were set out for arranging displays of the various kinds of products produced using black pork in a well-ordered and eye-catching way for customers to clearly see what was on sale. A brief introduction related to black pork has been added to the internal open style working area, which is also where sample tasting of the meat products on sale is provided to directly satisfy customers' discerning palates and feast their eyes with a first hand sense experience. In addition, Mr. Hsieh, business owner of the company, is in the process of planning a BBQ dining area to furnish visitors with an increasingly diverse spectrum of experiences; and while partaking of barbecued black pork, visitors can take advantage of the opportunity to share with one another the beauty of Liudui Hakka culture.
