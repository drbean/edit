Now in the hands of the third generation, Dong Bao Black Pork Store raises the indigenous Taiwan “Liudui black pig” in a humane manner. Its approach includes broadcasting the flowing melodies of classical music in its pigpens to give its black pigs a happy and pleasant life environment. Because of their uncontaminated and superior quality without the addition of any kind of lean meat powder (eg, clenbuterol and ractopamine) or antibiotics, Dong Bao Black Pork meat products are implicitly trusted by the public. However, because the store front is narrow and cramped, the shopping experience provided for customers was sub-standard. Moreover, the shop is located on a downhill section of road, which made it difficult for visitors to see as they passed by. Hence, the work carried out in the counseling program included redesigning the height of an external wall, and reworking the company logo. In addition, the interior of the store was decorated with the representative flower of the Liudui Hakka community in Pingtung - the China Rose (hibiscus rosa-sinensis), creating a space welcoming visitors that conveyed a message about the wealth of Hakka culture. Furthermore, three sales areas were set out for displays of the various kinds of products produced using black pork in a well-ordered and eye-catching way. This allows customers to clearly see what is on sale. A brief introduction to black pork was added to the internal open style working area, which is also where sample tasting of the meat products on sale takes place, imparting information as customers directly satisfy their discerning palates and feast their eyes on pork first hand. In addition, Mr. Hsieh, business owner of the company, is in the process of planning a BBQ dining area to furnish visitors with an even wider range of experiences; and while they partake of barbecued black pork, allow them to take advantage of an opportunity to share with one another their impressions of the beauty of Liudui Hakka culture.
