The majority of the farmers in Xionglin Township, Hisnchu County grow Hai-Li Tangor citrus fruit for a living. However, the dramatic changes in weather in recent years have resulted in unpredictable harvests of the fruit, and this had led to a gradual decline in the industry. In order to promote the value of Hai-Li Tangor citrus fruit, Mr. Kun-Ping Huang, business owner of Anhsin Trading Company, devoted himself to developing a Hai-Li Tangor cake or bread, whose taste consumers have praised. Because of the relatively sourness of the Hai-Li Tangor citrus fruit, the technical counseling provided in the program focused on development of the flavor of the bread. Honey or dark brown sugar was added to a fermented starter dough, and so that it could be kept for a longer period of time while still maintaining its freshness, lactic acid and natto were also added and mixed in the dough, producing a Hai-Li Tangor active beneficial bacteria bread formula. Finally, testing for compliance with nutrition labeling regulations was carried out and the results approved, completing the technology research and development program. 
Anhsin Trading Company was originally a family-based baking workshop, however, the technology upgrade counseling provided by the program has enabled the company to raise its sights and embark on a plan to establish a large-scale processing factory to allow the flavorsome taste and nutrition of Hai-Li Tangor bread to open up business opportunities in the baking industry and help boost the Hakka area's agricultural economy.
