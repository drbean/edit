Jiang Tai Gong Dried Persimmon Trading Company is located on Beipu old street in Hisnchu, and apart from selling a variety of dried persimmons, the company also sells genuine Hakka preserved delicacies including bitter orange, orange marmalade, and preserved (pickled, dried) radish. The company originated as a traditional stall, and clearly lacked any distinguishing features of a brand, moreover, the stall was located in the innermost area of the old street in Beipu, and thus unable to attract the attention of visitors. As a consequence, there was of no advantage to their business no matter the number of visitors to Beipu old street. Hence, in order to remedy this situation, the counseling provided in the program involved redesigning the area surrounding the stall, and first employed black bamboo weaving to form a base on the surface of an image wall, which effectively accentuated the Jiang Tai Gong Company brand logo. Images of persimmons were then blended into the design of the ceiling and display stands, and the two side window frames were fully laden with persimmon cotton prints. Through the above redecoration, the store’s dried persimmon element and Hakka culture come together in a perfect blend to greatly intensify the company’s brand image. In addition, Ms. Mei-Shan Peng, business owner of the company, designed a large variety of educational DIY courses. with the hope that, through experiential marketing, action can be taken to not only effectively convey the enchanting splendor of Hakka culture but at the same time deliver fragrant and sweet persimmons to visitor centers.
