The acerbity of sour oranges makes them unsuitable for eating fresh, however, the unmatched and unique flavor concealed within the seemingly insignificant outer skin is the raw ingredient for Hakka orange marmalade. Often seen on the tables in Hakka households and Hakka restaurants, this marmalade is of considerable importance as a dip eaten together with bread in Hakka communities. “Jam Jam House Souvenir Jams Gift Box” uses the sour oranges abundantly produced locally in Hsinchu County, infused with rock sugar for a long time to produce the sweet and sour, savory-sour orange marmalade. This product transforms the hard work of farmers throughout the year into the taste of happiness at each bite.
