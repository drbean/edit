Shui Zhi Yang Trading Company is the principal supplier of bitter orange tea in the Miaoli District. In the past, the weather had a huge impact on the steaming and sun drying process of bitter orange tea, and the production process required a period lasting at least two years. Hence, in order to improve this problem, Mr. Te-Yue Chang, business owner of Shui zhi Yang, devoted himself to developing a "Hakka bitter orange tea steaming-drying machine." The incorporation of this patented technology into the production process of bitter orange tea has considerably shortened the production time, and reduced cost problems derived from variable environmental factors. The technological research and development process involved continuous experimentation, with the bitter orange tea being first placed in a “steamer” to allow water vapor to steam the bitter orange, after which the steamed bitter orange is moved to a "drying machine," which primarily utilizes heat convection as a substitute for exposure to sunshine. Accordingly, through the cyclic process of steaming and drying, the production process has been effectively shortened to seven months. 
Shui Zhi Yang Trading Company has reaped tremendous benefit from this patented technological development. Presently, a number of bitter orange tea factories have in succession inquired about purchasing a license to use the patented technology. Furthermore, the business owner Mr. Te-Yue Chang has already set about developing the next generation of the Bitter Orange Tea Steaming-Drying Machine, with the intention of creating additional benefits of bitter orange, and laying the foundations to promote the core values of bitter orange products.
