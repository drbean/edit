There is an inseparable relationship between citronella grass (lemongrass) and the migration, distribution, and culture of the Hakka ethnic group, and is a natural plant often used in the traditional day-to-day living of Hakka people. Citronella grass (lemongrass) is a variety of grass with an aromatic smell and oily content. The oil extracted from the citronella grass (lemongrass) is provided with the effectiveness to expel insects and repel mosquitoes. The bottle gourd (calabash) symbol conveys the meaning of good fortune and happiness. Pinewood is utilized to carve large and small gourds, and the gourds are then allowed to absorb citronella oil, after which they can be placed in the surroundings where insects and/or mosquitoes need to be expelled to allow the citronella odor to naturally repel the insects and mosquitoes. Thus, the gourds can replace any insecticide used in the home.
