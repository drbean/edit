There is an inseparable bond between citronella grass (lemongrass) and the Hakka ethnic group in their migrations, distribution, and culture. Citronella is a natural plant often used in the traditional day-to-day lives of Hakka people. Citronella grass (lemongrass) is a variety of grass with an aromatic smell and oily content. The oil extracted from the grass is effective in expelling insects and repelling mosquitoes. The bottle gourd (calabash) symbol on the product conveys the meaning of good fortune and happiness. Pinewood is utilized to carve large and small gourd shapes, and the gourds are then allowed to absorb citronella oil, after which they can be placed in surroundings where insects and/or mosquitoes need to be expelled, allowing the citronella odor to naturally repel the insects and mosquitoes. Thus, the gourds allow removal of any insecticide used in the home.
