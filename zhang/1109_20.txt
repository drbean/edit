The Hakka pronunciation for ginger is "Jiang Ma," and has the meaning of the mother taking care of the children. Hakka people often add ginger sugar when boiling stuffed dumplings made of glutinous rice flour in a soup as protection against the cold, in the same way that a mother gives her children warmth and affection. Yin Xuan Tea House assembles brown sugar, ginger sugar, and turmeric sugar into a gift set as a product symbolizing “Sugar Prepared in Three Ways,” which allows the consumer to enjoy the taste of three different brown sugar flavors at one time.
