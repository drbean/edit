In 1963, Huang Ji Flat Rice Noodles established their business and began to sell handmade flat rice noodles in Chutung market in Hsinchu. The flat rice noodles were produced from Taiwan pure rice using genuine Hakka craftsmanship, and because the flat rice noodles had an exceptionally springy texture, the noodles soon earned the full trust and confidence of local restaurant business operators and the general consumer. In order to publicize the flavorsome taste of his flat rice noodles, Mr. Yuan-Chin Huang, business owner of Huang Ji Flat Rice Noodles, set up a flat rice noodles DIY experience classroom to conduct classes on holidays. The counseling provided in the program carried out space reconstruction in order to strengthen the family store brand image, and included transforming the original aluminum entrance door into a four sided veneer door leaf, and mounting a flavorsome image of flat rice noodles being cooked on the shop front. Inside the shop, the right side was remodeled for use as the DIY experience area to facilitate on-site cooking of genuine Hakka cuisine inside the shop and sharing the cooked flat rice noodles with visitors. An explanation of the production process of handmade flat rice noodles is mounted on the wall on the other side of the shop to allow consumers to understand and appreciate the meticulous care taken in the production of flat rice noodles while savoring the delicious noodles served to them. In the future, apart from publicizing Hakka flat rice noodles in different outlets, the owner also plans to design a series of educational DIY courses to pass on Hakka rice culture to future generations.
