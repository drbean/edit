Huang Ji Flat Rice Noodles established their business and began to sell handmade flat rice noodles in Chutung market in Hsinchu in 1963. The flat rice noodles were produced from pure Taiwan rice using genuine Hakka craftsmanship, and because the flat rice noodles had an exceptionally springy texture, the noodles soon earned the favor of local restaurant business operators and the general consumer. In order to publicize the attractive taste of his flat rice noodles, Mr. Yuan-Chin Huang, business owner of Huang Ji Flat Rice Noodles, had set up a flat rice noodles DIY experience classroom to conduct classes on holidays. The counseling provided in the program resulted in the carrying out of space reconstruction to strengthen the family store brand image, and included replacing the original aluminum entrance door with a four sided veneer door leaf, and mounting an attractive image of flat rice noodles being cooked on the shop front. Inside the shop, the right side was remodeled for use as the DIY experience area to facilitate on-site cooking of genuine Hakka cuisine and discussing flat rice noodles with visitors. An explanation of how handmade flat rice noodles are produced is mounted on the wall on the other side of the shop to allow consumers to appreciate the meticulous care taken in the production of flat rice noodles as they savor the delicious noodles served to them. In the future, apart from publicizing Hakka flat rice noodles in different outlets, the owner also plans to design a series of educational DIY courses to pass on Hakka rice traditions to the younger generation.
