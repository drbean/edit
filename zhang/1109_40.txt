Park-Arts Workshop uses a blue dyeing technique, and an overdyeing and redyeing production process to produce dyed cloths blazing with color. The dyed cloth is then used to make chopsticks sleeves, which are matched with lacquered chopsticks and a chopsticks rest, which are crafted from rosewood using a complicated craftsmanship technique, in addition to a continuous lacquering using Taiwan lacquer and fine grinding. The chopsticks sets are produced using natural ingredients that are environmentally friendly, and provide consumers with a richer variety of choices that are not only practical but also living aesthetic articles of everyday use.
