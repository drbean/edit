The carefully selected old ginger used in our Brown Sugar Longan Ginger Tea comes from Jiang Ma Garden in Dahu Township located in Miaoli County. Because of Jiang Ma Gardenâ€™s favorable location, soil, climate, and surroundings, the old ginger produced locally is of exceptionally high quality. Meanwhile, old ginger has the effects of combating body oxidation, stimulating the appetite and tonifying the spleen, lowering the body temperature, refreshing the spirit, sterilizing and detoxifying, reducing swelling and relieving pain, and alleviating menstrual pain. In addition, when combined with fragrant and sweet brown sugar and longans, old ginger becomes a treasured resource for warming the body and soothing the mind.
