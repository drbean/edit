The Hakka pronunciation for pumpkin is "fan gua, which means 'foreign gourd'." "Pumpkin Story House" is Taiwan's first life story museum that takes the pumpkin as its theme. The husband and wife owners of the museum adhere to natural agricultural methods to plant and grow a variety of pumpkins, and apply pumpkins in traditional Hakka fine foods that includes a rich and diverse range of products, such as brown rice flour, and pumpkin cheese, all of which are suitable for for all ages from young to old to eat.
