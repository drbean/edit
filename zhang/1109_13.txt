The Hakka pronunciation for pumpkin is "fan gua, which means 'foreign gourd'." "Pumpkin Story House" is Taiwan's first life story museum that takes the pumpkin as its theme. The husband and wife owners of the museum believe in following natural agricultural methods to plant and grow a variety of pumpkins, and they apply pumpkins in a rich and diverse range of products, such as brown rice flour, pumpkin cheese and other traditional Hakka fine foods, all of which are suitable for for all ages from young to old to eat.
