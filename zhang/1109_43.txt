By following the ancient Hakka tea making process, which indicates that the reputation of their tea has a long history, Jia He Tea Store is the link between modern society and the harmonious predestined relationship of tea art. Proprietress Ms. Xie Cuixia was born into a Taiwanese family, and later in life married into a Hakka family. Starting from not understanding a single word of the Hakka language, she is now perfectly fluent. Therefore the tea store was given the name "Jia He Tea Store," with “Jia He” having the meaning, "being together is good." Production of its Oriental Beauty Tea uses natural agricultural methods to allow the specific variety of oolong tea it favors to grow as nature would have it, and in particular, to allow small green insects to bite the leaves before harvesting the tea. This gives the tea a distinctive fruity taste that consumers savor and appreciate.
