By following the ancient Hakka tea making process, which denotes that the reputation of their tea has a long history, Jia He Tea Store is the link between modern people and the harmonious predestined relationship of tea art. Proprietress Ms. Xie Cuixia was born into a Taiwanese family, and later in life married into a Hakka family. From not understanding a single word of the Hakka language, she is now perfectly fluent. Therefore the tea store was given the name "Jia He Tea Store," with “Jia He” having the meaning of "being together is good." The production method for producing Oriental Beauty Tea uses natural agricultural methods to allow a specific variety of oolong tea to grow as nature would have it allowing small green insects to bite the leaves before harvesting the tea. This gives the tea a taste with a distinctive fruity flavor for consumers to savor and appreciate.
