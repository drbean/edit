Students’ Perceptions of Online Cultural Exchange Program

Abstract
Various online communicative methods, such as blogs, emails, face book, twitter, text messengers, are used for the purpose of immediate communication. To create an authentic communicative environment, Online Cultural Exchange Program (OCEP) is designed for EFL students to practice communicating in written form with students from foreign countries. The participants in this study are from Taiwan, Japan or Indonesia. They were required to write within 200 words, introducing themselves, describing local culture or events, and finally summarizing and expressing their viewpoints after watching Ted Talks. This study attempts to investigate what the participants from Taiwan think of OCEP, with reference to communicating and exchanging ideas with foreign students online. The result showed that all the participants held a positive and favorable attitude toward OCEP. More than 75% of the participants said that online communication gave them an opportunity to think at greater length about their own culture or local issues. During the writing process, they had to look up new words or things they were not familiar with through the Internet or read the other participants’ writing, which enhanced indirectly their reading ability and increased their vocabulary. They learned to synthesize the information they had obtained, reorganize them in a logical order, and then write them down in their own words. In addition, reading the other participants’ writing made them aware of cultural differences and similarities. Based on the survey results, some pedagogical implications regarding how to encourage more interaction online are proposed.

Key words: cultural awareness, linguistic context, online cultural exchange program, online communication, situation context

Introduction

Globalization and internationalization is the context of economic and academic trends that are part of the reality of the 21st century (Altbach & Knight, 2007). To cope with the global academic environment, communicating with foreigners online has become increasingly frequent. With the widespread of globalization and information technology, the goals of English education in non-English speaking countries have recently undergone drastic changes, one such change being the introduction of computer-aided instruction, simultaneous long-distance learning, on-line or off-line e-learning. As well as learning knowledge, online networking, chatting, dating, gaming, etc. have also set new trends in foreign languages learning (Yee, 2006). Information technology offers an expansion of the amount, the variety, and the accessibility of input to learners and to the contexts of learning and teaching. Online resources provide students with an opportunity to be instructed individually and to become autonomous learners. The wealth of information is particularly suited for learners in this electronic age as it offers infinite possibilities for stimulating pertinent discussion, nurturing students’ intellectual curiosity, arousing their cultural awareness, and above all enhancing their English skills simultaneously. 

To this end, Online Cultural Exchange Program is developed and employed to address students’ needs of interacting internationally with their peers of different cultural background. The main objective of this program is to enable students to understand intercultural or cross-cultural differences and similarities, raise awareness of cultural diversity, communicate with people who do not have a shared language, and improve their writing skills. 

Participants of this online cultural exchange program are from three different countries, Japan, Indonesia and Taiwan. They are not native speakers of English; so they have to use English as a lingua franca for interaction (House, 2012; Jenkins, 2006), that is, a common means of communication. They are strongly recommended to send one initial post onto the forum and several replies to the others’ postings. They are assumed to collaborate with other students in exchanging information and in discussing the issues of designated topics. To increase intercultural communication and interaction, every participant is assigned a buddy from different countries.

Although participants from Taiwan had been studying English for more than twelve years by the time this study was conducted, this was their first and real-time experience of interacting with foreigners online. Therefore, this study was designed to investigate what they thought of this online cultural exchange forum in terms of language acquisition and intercultural competence. Their perceptions or suggestions can be served as the drive toward future improvement.

Theoretical Framework

The ultimate goal of school education is to enhance student learning outcomes (Fullan, 2007). Taking students’ motivation, information technology and their communicative competence into consideration, this study tries to incorporate those factors into task-based activities, hoping that Taiwanese participants can use English as a lingua franca, to get the meaning across instead of focusing on form. Through interacting with foreigners, they will hopefully be equipped with intercultural communicative competence and citizenship. After composing their messages, reading their peers’ postings and reflecting critically, it is hoped that they become more aware of cultural differences and similarities, respect other’s culture values, avoid stereotype and misunderstanding (Chao, 2014). 

Motivation plays an important role in knowledge and language acquisition (Ryan & Deci, 2000) When students are motivated internally, they will take the initiative to learn the target language and outperform those who are under-motivated ( Brown, 1994) . Nowadays, students enjoy surfing the internet. They are no longer confined to learn from the teachers in the classroom; they can learn anywhere and anytime as long as they can access the Internet. Internet resources expand the pool of input to language learners and enlarge the language learning context (Pennington, 1996). They increase the diversity and variety of types of input available, offering new sources of information and partners for interaction such as by e-mail (Warschauer, 1995), Internet browsing and chat activities (Lam, 2000; Warschauer, 1995), or on-line writing conferences (Sullivan & Pratt, 1996). Computerizing the teaching can make teachers become more effective communicators and more competitive teachers. Internet has become invaluable aids in many areas of our lives and learning language through technology has become a fact of life (Chapelle, 2001). Therefore, Reinders and Wattana (2014) promoted online games or chat to be integrated into instructional design to foster learners' willingness to interact and communicate with one another.

Notable for the convenient accessibility, online learning has been developed and employed to improve learning and teaching for several years. It challenges both teachers and students (Ally, 2004), but it has several advantages. It is time and place independent (Harasim, 1990). Learners can access it anytime, anywhere, work at their own pace (Harasim, 1990), remain concealed (Simonson, Smaldino, Albright, & Zvacek, 2000), and more importantly, it makes store and retrieve information more effectively (Richardson & Swan, 2003). The only disadvantage is that it lacks face-to-face interactions (Richardson & Swan, 2003).  

Online interaction, such as Facebook, Twitter, forums, online dating and networking, serves two major functions: language acquisition and intercultural communication. From the perspective of communication theory, cultures are performative, that is, they exist as they take shape in the words, symbols, rituals and interactions of people. (Beamer, 2001). Communication, the process of sharing meaning through verbal and nonverbal behavior, is influenced by cultural values, attitudes, and behavior. To avoid miscommunication, it is critical to understand intercultural or cross-cultural issues, the informal and often hidden patterns of human interactions, expressions, and viewpoints that people in one culture share. Therefore, while interacting with others online, users do not aim to master a language for all purposes and functions. They master the codes that are sufficient for the functions they want the language to perform. It is obvious English is used as a lingua franca. 

According to Larsen-Freeman (2000), task-based language teaching means providing a natural context for relatively realistic language use, focusing the learner’s attention on a real-world task, problem, activity, or topic, and not on a particular language point (Stern, 1992). Task-based instruction includes pre-task, during task and post-task stages (Ellis, 2003). In this study, the during task activities employed include opinion exchange, personal experience sharing, narrative, and comprehension-based reasoning (Rebecca, 2006). Many researches prove that target language acquisition has a close relationship with classroom participation and interaction (Ely, 1986; Ellis, 1988; Pica, 1994). Providing practices in the classroom promote learning outcome (Cheng, 2004; Herbert & Burt, 2003). In addition, different types of writing such as responses to a reading, summaries, or any type of posting need to be guided and practiced (Sokolik, 2003). Therefore, participants were encouraged to complete their ‘initial post’ during class hours, focusing on the exchange of meaningful messages for communicative purposes (Long, 1987; Pica, 198). After class, they could login the program, revise their writing or reply to other’s messages freely. 

Method
Participants
Students participating in this online cultural exchange program are from Japan, Indonesia and Taiwan. Japanese participants were 34 sophomores, majoring in Agriculture at University of Miyazaki. Another 50 Indonesian participants were freshmen from University of Brawijaya, majoring in Agricultural Economics. Though there were three groups of participants, the survey was only administered to Taiwanese students, 56 senior students majoring in Business Management at National United University. On average, their English proficiency belonged to CEF B1 level, with better reading than writing. 

To encourage more mutual interaction and communication, a buddy pair policy was employed. Each participant was assigned a student of different nationality as his/her buddy, paired up by the program manager, Professor Araki Tamao from Universtiy of Miyazaki, Japan.  

Procedure
This program, lasting for eight weeks, is divided into five stages, each of which deals with a definite theme and targeted skills. Each stage will be opened for initial posting and discussion one by one according to the schedule. After completing the five stages, the forum is still open for three more weeks, allowing students to wrap up their contribution. 

Participants are recommended to choose a more specific topic under each theme and write their messages or thoughts on the forums at http://ocep.vss.miyazaki-u.ac.jp/esp/. Themes for discussion in each stage are as follows. 
Stage l: introduce themselves and their places (including universities) on forums 
Stage 2: describe some flora and fauna species living in their universities’ campus  or some cultural events or customs common in the university’s region 
Stage 3: watch the TedTalks “How to green the world’s deserts and reverse climate change” given by Alan Savory, and then discuss the video material related to some environmental issue or any specific ideas 
Stage 4: watch TedTalks “Why business can be good at solving social problems” given by Michael Porter, and then discuss this issue and write down the opinion
Stage 5: pick up one idea concerning local environmental, agricultural, or agro-economic issues to share with the participants from other countries 

While Taiwanese participants were undertaking their tasks, the teacher usually walked around the class to see if they needed any help. If they failed to complete the task in class, they were required to finish the assignment within the designated time after class. A total of five initial postings accounted for 30% of their final grade and replies earned extra credits. A survey concerning their attitudes and perceptions of this online cultural exchange was conducted at the end of the program. 
Results and Discussion
Though participants of online cultural exchange program include Japanese, Indonesian, and Taiwanese, the survey results detailed in this section were gathered from Taiwanese students.

Around 80% of the participants said they felt excited to exchange ideas with foreign students and interested in the topic chosen for discussion in each stage. Since they had never experienced communicating with foreigners in written form, they thought it was a good opportunity to practice writing and communicate real-time with foreigners. More than 78% felt participating in this program helped improve their English writing ability. They thought at greater length of the issues that they wanted to discuss or share so as to express them more clearly and appropriately. As a result, during the whole program, they took the lead in posting the messages, led the discussion and took the initiative to interact with their buddy and answer others’ questions. Knowing that both Japanese and Indonesian students would read their postings, they spent more time looking for references and composing their messages than usual. They tried their best to write clearly and appropriately for fear that foreign students might misunderstand what they had posted, such as Chinese culture, customs, their viewpoints, or ideas. More than 75% said because they wanted to better their writing and make their expressions more clearly, they often accessed the forum after class several times to revise their initial posting, read others’ postings, or respond to their peers’ questions. The average access rate of each student, reaching 5.6 times per student, indirectly supported the above statements.

More than 70% said that they preferred to read the postings written by both Japanese and Indonesian students. By reading the messages posted by foreign students, they learned more about foreign culture, customs, food, scenic spots, trends, etc. Most important of all, they learned to look at things from different perspectives. They realized that there was no right-or-wrong, good-or-bad in terms of viewpoints, culture, food, or customs; there were only differences. Three of them said it was easier to understand the messages written by their classmates than those of foreign students. It was possible that their classmates’ language ability was better than that of foreign students. It was also possible that due to cultural influences the way foreign students expressed themselves was different from those of their classmates. One reflected that she felt the foreign students were hard working and had better and profound views on global issues than her classmates. To sum up, they benefited a lot from this activity -- learning to respect, appreciate and accept others’ differences, they said.

Ten of them said being able to interact with foreigners and be understood, they felt a great sense of success and achievement that they had never had before. They thought it was a rewarding and enriching experience. In the future, they would like to participate in any similar online forum or conferencing. They were willing to recommend this program to those who have never experienced communicating with foreigners. 

Speaking of their favorite topic for discussion, none of them liked to discuss local plants, probably because they were business majors and did not familiarize themselves with any plants. Thirty-five out of 56 said that they preferred to discuss local culture and customs, especially their favorite local food. Eighteen participants preferred self-introduction, because it was easier for them to make friends and share their common interests. Fourteen liked to watch the TedTalks and then discuss the issues related to the topic. They said the speech was informative and the topic worth pondering. They needed to reflect the key points mentioned and figure out how to deal with the raised problems. They learned to use different approaches or perspectives to look at the problem. They felt their interests and attention to social issues were aroused, and more importantly, their critical thinking and reflective ability were strengthened. 

Unlike the traditional writing classes, they all agreed that such kind of on-line activity did give them a lot of pressure because everyone could read each other’s writing and make comparisons. They felt less pressurized from their peers while they were required to do pencil-and-paper writing, because no one except the teacher would read the writing. However, pressure is not always a bad thing. Twenty of them said that because of peer pressure, they paid more attention to their writing. They spent more time generating, composing, reviewing and revising their writing. To be sure, such kind of positive learning attitude would enhance learning outcomes.

Two participants said joining the online forum, they could communicate with foreigners without going abroad. Learning that many Japanese and Indonesians are interested in Taiwan and Taiwanese culture, they felt very proud to live in this wonderful land. Ideas sharing and exchanging broadened their global knowledge and viewpoints. They found that using English for communication was not the same as preparing for the exam. Fluency and appropriate expressions played a more important role than accuracy. It was refreshing and rewarding to exchange ideas and viewpoints with foreigners online, they explained further.


Conclusion

The survey revealed that students held positive attitudes towards online cultural exchange. More than three-quarters of the participants preferred to post and interact with foreign students. They said that they could surf the Net and look for the references or vocabulary they did not know as well as do the exercises anywhere, anytime as long as Internet was available. In addition, they could revise their writing several times until they were satisfied with their work. Because every participant could read, comment, or respond to each other’s messages they concentrated more on synthesizing, composing and expressing their ideas in a well-organized order. They experienced using English as a medium of communication instead of a subject learning at school. They became aware of cultural differences and similarities. After completing the task of posting messages online, they felt a great sense of success that they seldom experienced in previous English classes. Above all, they learned to think critically and reflect more profoundly concerning social issues. 

In conclusion, this online cultural exchange program offered participants opportunities to learn about cultural diversity in a professional and ethical manner, by providing knowledge, sensitivity and respect for the values of others, but equally important, knowledge of and respect for their own values. With the help of information technology, online communication is easier to provide practice opportunities and immediate feedback. It has great potential to foster student interpersonal communicative and presentation skills as it offers more learning opportunities for students to interact with peers. It helps develop and build social relationships and mutual trust among online community members (Bulu & Yildirim, 2008), strengthen peer relationships and connectedness (Lee & Bonk, 2016), with an aim to reinforce student learning outcomes in a class-wide learning community.

Suggestion and Implication
Though the majority of participants held positive attitude towards online cultural exchange, there were still some who had negative responses. Five of them said that the program was not user-friendly. They hoped that they could be notified of while someone was responding to their messages. Ten of them said that their buddy never interacted with them. Even though they wrote to them, they did not reply at all. If the buddy pair policy could be successfully implemented, the interaction between paired members might be more frequent, leading to better results. Six of them said that the English proficiency of the participants varied greatly and some of them did not seem to devote themselves to writing. So they did not learn a lot from this exchange forum. One suggested that using more popular topic or mini-video or movie strips for discussion would increase more interaction. Those suggestions given by the participants in this study will be taken into consideration for future improvement.

In this study, the participants had learned how to write, but they seldom did it. It appeared that they felt nervous and pressurized when asked to write. The atmosphere in the classroom was tense and unpleasant. During the first stage, most of them read other’s posts first, look for references online, and then compose their ideas and write. Gradually, they spent less time composing their ideas; they felt easier and more comfortable while writing. Such kind of online interactive activity encouraged active participation on the part of the students. Because it was a responsive, self-paced, and personalized practice, they had more confidence in taking risks while writing in English. Most important of all, it helped keep a record of individual progress.

Several pedagogical guidelines could be derived from the participants' feedback and perspectives. As we know, teaching is a mutual cooperation and interaction between teachers and students. As noted by Vaughan (2010), teacher presence plays an essential role in promoting a blended community of inquiry among online learners as well as encourages “off-task talk” in online discussions. It is suggested that teachers are present in class to offer more guidance, support, and encouragement to assist students' learning process.

The data for this study were gathered from a group of Taiwanese students. The conclusion can not be generalized. Future study will include Japanese and Indonesian participants to see if they hold the same perspectives as those of Taiwanese participants.
