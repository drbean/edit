*Books and the City*:

Social changes featured in *The Jane Austen Book Club*

Introduction

Karen Joy Fowler's *The Jane Austen Book Club* (2004) is about the five
female members,

Jocelyn, Allegra, Prudie, Bernadette, Sylvia, and the single male member, Grigg,
of a book club who gather for monthly meetings to discuss Austen's six
novels, *Emma*, *Sense and Sensibility*, *Mansfield Park*, *Northanger
Abbey*, *Pride and Prejudice*, and *Persuasion* from March through
August, at their homes in early twenty-first century Central Valley,
California.

This essay is about how *The Jane Austen Book Club* portrays such
social changes as the emergence of third wave feminism, a movement associated with book club discussions among American women of the novels of Jane Austen,
among others, and the rise of popular culture icons like *Sex and the City,* (SATC) a
popular American romantic sitcom series, whose
influences are clearly reflected in the life styles and narratives of
the book club members.

An American postmodernist writer, Karen Joy Fowler (1950-) says that
readers don't have to be familiar with Jane Austen's works to enjoy the
book, which can be compared to a tapestry gently woven from two kinds
of narrative thread, Austen's as warp, and Fowler's as weft, with some
sparkling pop culture magic cast over its surface, making the book
welcoming, generous and fun.

Though Jane Austen lived in a totally different era, there are things in
common shared by the narratives and the interests of the ladies in Jane Austen's
books and the women, and man, in Fowler's. What makes these women of two
hundred years apart resonate so much with each other?

Chapter 1 Why book clubs?

The book club wave in the late twentieth century US was inspired
by third wave feminism that emerged at the same time. Pamela Burger says, 'Leisure reading groups
have become a full-fledged phenomenon since 1989, and are now found
everywhere from offices to religious communities to, increasingly,
virtual platforms.' (Burger, 2015)

But the phenomenon had numerous forerunners, including Puritan Bible-study groups.
The most significant were women's
culture clubs that emerged out of the late nineteenth century
progressive movements. The members of these clubs were mostly white
women from the middle and upper-middle classes and they gathered to
discuss literature, history, and the fine arts, rather than social
reform, which was often the concern of the first and the second wave
feminists. (Burger, 2015)

Though it might be hard for millenials to imagine that "home" was the only
place where Americans believed a woman should be 150 years ago, even
bright, inquisitive and determined American women had few opportunities
to display their talents in those days. Education and career
opportunities were few, no skill-developing beyond household chores such as
needlework or cooking was expected of them, let alone 
involvement in the community. Mothers and wives were thoroughly expected to
focus on caring for their families as good examples of moral behavior.

(National Women's History Museum, 2014)

But, society between the 1870s and 1920s was involved in a long process of
community building. Various voluntary organizations were formed in 
neighborhoods among which were women's clubs, and these became the major vehicle
for American women to network and learn about social issues in order to
develop their talents for the world beyond their homes. A book club was
often one of the outcomes.

(National Women's History Museum, 2014)

However, most people in the 1950s still felt that women should be
homemakers and men, breadwinners. It was only in the late twentieth
century that women, working at home or outside, gradually started to gain
more freedom and leisure time and were able to leave spouses, children, and household
chores behind in order to spend time with other women--their friends and
co-workers--outside the home. This improvement of women's status could not
have been realized without the feminist movement.

According to Encyclopedia Britannica, 'The third wave was made
possible by the greater economic and professional power and status
achieved by women of the second wave, [and] the massive expansion in
opportunities for the dissemination of ideas created by the information
revolution of the late twentieth century..' (Burkett, 2020)

However, the book club boom of recent decades cannot be fully explained
without referring to Oprah's Book Club, a TV book discussion club
segment which started in 1996 as a segment of Oprah Winfrey's popular
talk show. Millions of women followed Oprah's Book Club template: A few
friends meet at the host's home, a library meeting room, or at Starbucks
and discuss the monthly selection over tea, lunch or dinner, and share
their personal stories. (Burger, 2015) 　　　　　　　　　

As Jocelyn, a founder of the 'all-Jane-Austen-all-the-time' book club
in the book says, 'Real people are really complicated.' The members of
the newly founded book club certainly prove this to be true. As in
Austen's novels, the intricate plot slowly reveals the private lives of the
members.

Chapter 2 Why Austen?

Jane Austen still attracts the devotion of readers in America, two centuries after
her most celebrated novel, *Pride and Prejudice* appeared. Why is the work of this
nineteenth-century 'English' mannerist writer so appealing to Americans?

It is clear that it was the popularity of Jane Austen book clubs in the
late twentieth century which inspired Fowler, a big fan of Austen, to
write the novel. In fact, Fowler decided to write the book when she
realized a sign she saw at a book shop wasn't a book title, but 
actually an invitation to one of the real Jane Austen book clubs which
were becoming popular in the US.

But, according to the Jane Austen Society of North America, JASNA, 'Jane Austen
(1775-1817) was never publicly acknowledged as a writer during her
lifetime.' She passed away at the age of forty-one in 1817 with only
six novels to her name. (Kelly, 2013)

In fact, her works were out of print and she was almost completely forgotten in the 1820's,
before slowly gaining fame and popularity.

In 1870, the family's *Memoir* that was published by Austen's nephew
attracted much attention and by 1890 the first wave of Janeites (Jane
Austen devotees), who hoped that 'Austen would take a rightful
place next to or near Shakespeare,' had appeared. (Reeves, 2010)

The publication of *The Novels of Jane Austen* (vol.1-5) in 1923, from
Oxford's Clarendon Press, also raised Austen's status from fan idol
to that of a writer suitable for critical analysis. (Reeves, 2010)

Though Janeites would mostly agree that it is the romance and relationships
that attracts them to Austen's world, there seems to be additional reasons for
their enthusiasm. An American member of JASNA, thinks that Austen's
popularity in America comes from an Anglophile tendency of its people, and
a longing for the elegance of the time. That is, America is in love with British
culture, most of the time.

(Kelly, 2013)

Janeite, Janeitism, Austenmania, or Janemania, in whatever way Austen devotees
are referred to, they not only read the novels of Austen, but also write
sequels or spin-offs, either based on Austen's original plots or 
extending them to create Austen-style fan fiction. At fan events,
conventions, tea parties, banquets and balls held by JASNA, Janeites
from around the world enjoy lectures, dance workshops, antique
exhibitions, with many of the participants in bonnets and early
nineteenth-century-style costume. Some critics call this fanatical fandom
worship of Janeites, an "Austen cult."

Austen scholar Deidre Lynch compares this phenomenon to time-travelling
and says that Janeites are trying to preserve a 'vanished Englishness or
set of "traditional" values.' ('Janeite,' Wikipedia) However, she notes
that Austen\'s works are now considered to be part of 'both high culture
and popular culture.' ('Reception history of Jane Austen,' Wikipedia)

Chapter 3 Austen in chick lit and pop culture

At the end of the 20th century, a second Janeite wave emerged in
chick lit--contemporary novels directed primarily at women--and pop
culture. In the course of commercialization of the Austen brand and the media
frenzy over chick lit merchandise, Austen's novels and personal life
were adapted into books, movies, journals, magazines,
blogs, YouTube clips and even stationery, board games, clothing, and shoes,
in greatly varied ways depending on the creators' faithfulness to the
original. (Mitchell, 2012)

According to Encyclopedia Britannica, 'in reaction and opposition to
stereotypical images of women as passive, weak, \[...\] or alternatively
as domineering, demanding, \[...\] the third wave \[of feminism\] redefined
women and girls as assertive, powerful and in control of their own
sexuality."

(Burkett, 2020)

In popular culture, this redefinition gave rise to powerful
iconic singers such as Madonna and Riot Grrrl and the four Manhattan career women
in *Sex and the City* (1998-2004), a romantic sitcom series based on
Candace Bushnell's best-selling book of the same name.

"Chick lit" or chick literature, a genre of popular postfeminist fiction
confirms the link between Austen, Bushnell and Fowler.

Diana Abu Ujum reports in her paper (2017) that Austen and Fowler's
works are both seen to be chick lit.

> Many scholars, readers, and novelists of Chick Lit, \[...\] claim that
> Jane Austen was the original Chick Lit pioneer. \[...\] In fact, many
> Chick Lit novels are modern adaptations of Austen's six novels.
> \[...\] The content of Austen's novels have also become fodder for
> original storylines like Karen Joy Fowler's *The Jane Austen Book
> Club*.
>
> (Ujum, 2017, pp. 41-42)

Stephanie Harzewski endorses Ujum's point of view.

> The chick lit genre is best exemplified by *Sex and the City*
> and \[...\] adventures of their protagonists－typically a
> single, urban media professional－\[...\] Marrying elements of the
> popular romance with the satiric aspects of the novel of manners, chick
> lit extends Jane Austen's comedic legacy and brings elements of
> adventure fiction to the contemplative tradition of the novel of
> manners. (Harzewski, 2011, Introduction)

As Ujim and Harzewski point out, the traditional novel of manners and
current chic lit both focus on "society and culture," and that
could be the point where Austen, Fowler and Bushnell all meet. In
fact, *The Jane Austen Book Club* is full of countless instances of cues taken from Jane
Austen in wit, irony, humor, timeless stories, people and their
relationships, matchmaking, etc. and from SATC in love, loss, betrayal,
career ups and downs, open talk about sex, true love and happily-ever-after
endings, just to name a few. Actually Fowler couldn't wait to see
the readers find SATC elements. One of the questions for discussion at
the end of the book is, "Which of the women in *Sex and the City* is Dean
really most like?" (Harzewski, 2011, Introduction)

CONCLUSION

With the end of the Cold War in 1989 and the collapse of the Soviet
Union in 1991, America began to integrate into the global market economy
as the internet started to make the world more interconnected.

Social changes in the late twentieth century US, such as the third wave
feminism and popular culture emerged in this booming economy that was
generated by globalization, and pop culture served as the cultural and
social backdrop for the book*.*

As Fowler says in her book, 'The Jane Austen Book Club members meet in
each other's living rooms, where they share their individual
interpretations, life experiences, laughter, food and friendship,' the
book is filled with characters and plots similar to the ones from
Austen's novels.

Though the problems Jocelyn, Allegra, Prudie, Bernadette, Sylvia and
Grigg encounter during the six months, somehow resemble the ones that
Austen's characters are faced with. Nothing much happens in Fowler's
story as in Austen's novels, and yet everything happens in each book.
