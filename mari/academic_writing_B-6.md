3）The original passage in Japanese:

「文献を読んでノートを取ると言う段階は、論文作成の中で最も時間をかけるべき段階である。利用した文献が多ければそれだけ内容のある論文が作成できる可能性が高いことはいうまでもないが、それと同時に、様々な文献を読むことで論文の構想自体が具体化し、より洗練されたものになっていく。読んでノートを取る文献はすべてが論文に利用できるわけではない。最初はトピックを絞り込む意味でかなり広い範囲の文献を読み進めるが、論文の構成が徐々に具体的に見えてくるにつれて、自然により専門的な文献へと移行していくのが望ましいかたちである。」

４）DeepL automatic translation of the above passage into English：

The stage of reading the literature and taking notes is the stage of
thesis writing that should be the most time consuming. It goes without
saying that the more references you use, the more likely it is that you
will be able to produce a more substantial paper, but at the same time,
the idea of the paper itself will become more concrete and refined as
you read a variety of references. Not all of the literature that you
read and take notes on is available for your paper. It is desirable to
read a fairly wide range of literature at first in order to narrow down
the topic, but as the structure of the paper gradually becomes more
concrete, you will naturally move on to more specialized literature.

５）Mari's summary translation: Please check this passage.

Reading the literature and taking notes is the most time-consuming, but also very
rewarding, part of the thesis writing process. It is advisable to start with
extensive reading of a wide variety of sources before narrowing down the research topic, and then, as the
form of the paper becomes clearer and more refined, gradually move on to
more specialized reference materials. (Andrew Armour and others,
*Academic Writing Oyo-hen*: *Bungaku, Bunka-kenkyu no Eigo-ronbun
Sakusei-ho (Academic Writing Advanced Level: How to Write an English
Dissertation on Literature and Cultural Studies)*, (Keio University
Press, 1999), p.32)

Broad reference to the secondary literature (books, journals and research) helps
make the paper, ensures its profoundness, and forces
vague ideas to be developed into a more sophisticated thesis, (even though not all the notes that are taken
will be used). In order to gradually realize what needs to go into the paper,
the best way probably is to start reading extensively,
extracting the knowledge of other writers, and in the process of extracting that knowledge, developing one's own about the work under consideration.

Reading and making notes of the literature is the most time-consuming, but rewarding,
process in thesis writing. The broad reference to the literature (books,
journals and research) ensures the profoundness of the paper, and helps
a plan become a sophisticated thesis, (even though not all the
notes taken can be used in it.) In order to gradually realize the form
of the paper, the best way probably is to start reading a wide range of secondary literature,
extracting knowledge from it. The process of extracting that knowledge will make the paper richer in content.
